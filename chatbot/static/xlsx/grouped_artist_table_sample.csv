"AACHEN, Hans von","00002-j_couple.jpg, 00004-selfport.jpg, 00000-allegory.jpg","At the end of the 16th century the court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague was one of the most important art and cultural centre of Europe. The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Aachen studied in Italy, he spent there 14 years and was known as a portraitist. He went to Munich and worked for the Bavarian Prince. He moved to Prague in 1592 and became court painter at the court of Rudolph II.In addition to mythological subjects he painted realistic genre pictures with two-three figures | Hans von Aachen was an artist who fully embraced the self-portrait as a means of artistic expression. His earliest self-portrait was executed c. 1574, and he painted several other self-portraits during his career | The painting, displaying the characteristic Mannerist style of the artist, is also known as The Triumph of Justice"
"AAGAARD, Carl Frederik","00006-rosegard.jpg, 00005-deerlake.jpg","This painting is unusual in 19th century art in combining landscape with still-life. In the acutely observed flowers the artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant landscape. The two figures, possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the composition | The painting is signed and dated 'C F Aagaard 1888' at lower left"
"ABADIA, Juan de la",00007-michael.jpg,"The archangel Michael was, like St. George the dragon-killer, one of the typically warlike saints so greatly approved in the age of chivalry. The Bible tells us that he fought with Satan for the body of Moses and we can read in the Apocalypse how he defeated the dragon with seven heads and ten horns. St. Michael was therefore looked upon as one of the principal patrons of the Church who, having overcome Satan, could protect all innocent souls from the Devil.This painting illustrates the somewhat provincial style of Juan de la Abadia of Huesca. The heritage of the Trecento can be seen in the delicate, girlish countenance of the saint and the brilliant tints of the wings, but blended with it is the elegance associated with the International Gothic style. The figures are wooden and lifeless and the artist's limited knowledge of anatomy may be seen in his representation of the soul; but the carefully arranged pattern of the floor creates the illusion of space, indicating that the artist was aware of the later developments of Gothic art and was to some extent influenced by early Renaissance art"
"ABBATE, Niccol dell'","00017-scipio.jpg, 00014-deerhunt.jpg, 00012-chimney1.jpg, 00016-proserpi.jpg, 00015-orpheus.jpg","This painting is typical of the elegant art emerging in Fontainebleau inspired by Primaticcio | ""In a fabulous setting we see the last moments of a stag hunt. The very small size of the figures in the foreground does not prevent the artist from lingering over every detail of the elegant clothing, the hairstyles and the harness of the horses. We sense a refined climate of diversion that was certainly inspired by  the Estense court of the castle of Ferrara, from which """"Camerini"""" this painting probably comes. The natural scenery, which shows the influence of Dosso Dossi's landscapes and numerous aspects of Flemish art, is lit up in the background by unreal flashes of light, oscillating between pale pink and gray-green, from which ruins emerge, the spires of fairytale works of architecture"" | The chimney breast was realized by the workshop of Niccol&#242; dell' Abbate. It features figures, putti, flowers, fruit, and symbols (among them the sword symbolizing the constable's office) in trompe-l'oeil painting | In this painting - which may belong to a series of landscapes painted in 1570 for the Cabinet du Roi in the Ch&#226;teau de Fontainebleau - the artist applies the formula of a vast landscape animated by small, graceful figures. He takes as his source works by Joachim Patenier | King Francis I of France concentrated his patronage of art and artists on the decoration of the Chateau of Fontainebleau. To this and he imported such major artists as he could. He did get the aging Leonardo, he imported Rosso in 1530, Primaticcio in 1532, then Niccol&#242; dell'Abbate, Vignola, Andrea del Sarto, Cellini. Some stayed, some went back; but the work they left behind was decisive in the replacement of Gothic style in France.The Fontainebleau decorations included a Long Gallery, a Ballroom and several royal rooms. Only a fraction survives, since much were destroyed in later rebuildings, and most of the paintings were drastically restored in the nineteenth century.Niccol&#242; dell'Abbate arrived about 1552. His main contribution was his fantastic landscapes, which are a genre quite apart from from either the poetic realism found in late fifteenth-century Italian pictures, or the homely kind in the background of the Raphael cartoons. They have a dreamlike quality with extremes of light and colour, rainbows and flickering storms."
"ABBATI, Giuseppe","00021-abbati4.jpg, 00018-abbati1.jpg, 00020-abbati3.jpg, 00019-abbati2.jpg","More a genre painting than a portrait, this woman is standing near a fireplace resting her hands on the back of a chair, a pose that was customary in portrait photography at that time. The composition focuses on her long, bluish dress and the bonnet, held down by a black scarf, while her features are only summarily executed in large daubs of colours | The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.Abbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello | Abbati painted in the cloisters of Santa Croce in Florence in 1861-62 while the monument was being restored. Numerous black and white marble blocks were strewn around the grounds, offering clear-cut shapes and sharp, elementary contrasts. Beyond the empty foreground, a row of stones is placed against the shaded walkway of the cloisters, with only the figure of a worker or stonemason as a living element in this rather abstract composition | To this day, the hilly Tuscan countryside is dotted with olive groves and ominous cypress trees, frequently found along roadsides and near cemeteries. Abbati chose a patch of sandy, yellow road for the foreground, where long afternoon shadows are casting the shades of other cypress trees to be imagined outside of the picture plane. Large areas of different hues are effectively played off against one another in a rather abstract fashion"
"ABBATINI, Guido Ubaldo",00022-cornaro.jpg,"""In Rome it was customary to decorate church choirs on high church holidays with temporary decorations constructed of coloured papier m&#226;ch? or canvas. The most famous of these are the ones created by Pietro da Cortona for the forty-hour prayer in Rome's San Lorenzo in Damaso during Holy Week in 1633. Drawings and engravings of these temporary """"sacred sets"""" are the earliest evidence of the increasing tendency in the seventeenth century to transform church spaces into stages for heavenly apparitions and visions. One of the first decorations belonging to this category was the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In it architecture, sculpture, and painting combine to form a theatrical whole. The saint and the angel in the famous Ecstasy of St Teresa function as the performers, while the saint's vision is entrusted to the medium of fresco, executed by Guido Ubaldo Abbatini"""

"ACHENBACH, Oswald",00034-firework.jpg,"Achenbach's favourite theme was the striking states of nature: a moonlit night, thunderclouds, fog, and so on. In the present work, his effective approach doubles the real-life event in pursuit of the same goal: a powerful visual impression."
"ADAM, Albrecht","00036-hunt.jpg, 00035-battle.jpg","Albrecht Adam was one of the most celebrated German equestrian and military artists of the early nineteenth century. The present landscape with huntsmen returning from the hunt was commissioned around 1828 as one of a pair of hunting pictures by Felix Georg von Voss, the owner of Schloss Schorssow whose family held substantial estates in Pomerania and Prussia. In the background of the picture is a large, nine-bay country house, shown from the south-east side across the lake identifiable as Schloss Schorssow, built on the banks of Lake Haussee in Pomerania in North-East Germany | Albrecht Adam is best known as a battle painter; his patrons included Marshal Radetzky, Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, Archduke Charles Ludwig, and King Maximilian II. The present painting represents the battle of Moscow on 7 September 1812."
"ADEMOLLO, Luigi","00072-lucca3.jpg, 00067-ark2.jpg, 00065-ark.jpg, 00068-ark3.jpg, 00066-ark1.jpg, 00069-chapel.jpg, 00070-lucca1.jpg, 00071-lucca2.jpg","Ademollo decorated the walls of the Sala degli Staffieri (Room of the Staff) with frescoes depicting scenes from Roman history and showing ancient Roman monuments.The picture shows a detail of the scene Events in the Life of Licinius Sura | This scene is a detail of the fresco cycle in the Room of the Ark. This shows the preparation of a Jewish festivity that is about to take place under a tentlike structure. Baskets of bread and jars of wine are being set up for distribution to the crowds during the celebration. The display of the massive menorah, a golden candelabrum with seven arms, serves as the dominating symbol of the Jewish people | Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.Ademollo decorated the Room of the Ark with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people. Before the backdrop of classical architecture, a multitude of people are moving in a frieze-like procession with the Holy Ark being carried under the leadership of the high priest. The scenes are rich in narrative detail and reveal the artist's ability for elaborate historical recreations | This scene is a detail of the fresco cycle in the Room of the Ark.
