14560-06macbet.jpg,"Fuseli was the second son of the Zurich portraitist and author Johann Caspar Fussli. His early contact with the teachings of Johann Jakob Bodmer familiarized him with the figures of world literature, which were to remain a major source of inspiration throughout his career. Ordained in 1761 as a pastor in the Zwinglian Reformed Church, he left Zurich two years later for political reasons, traveling by way of Berlin to London, where he settled. Initially Fuseli made his living by writing, while engaged in illustrating the works of his favourite authors, particularly William Shakespeare.The painting represents a scene from Shakespeare's Macbeth. It shows Lady Macbeth as a a sleep-walker in the corridor of a fortress.

23540-2hunyadi.jpg,"""From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, Hungarian painters began to paint historical scenes as well as landscapes, portraits and genre paintings. It was not merely a fashion in Hungary to follow the current Romantic Movement that originated in Paris, or the """"historism"""" of the Munich and Vienna Academies; it went much deeper than that. At the defeat of the fight for independence, the nation escaped into its history. Along with Hungarian poets and writers, the painters recalled the glorious events of the past, searching for ideals of patriotism and heroism that had not been crushed by despotism.Viktor Madarász gained the first international appreciation for Hungarian painting when his picture, """"The Bewailing of László Hunyadi"""" won the State Grand Prix at the 1861 Paris Salon Exhibition. This rather romantic historical painting of the Hunyadi tragedy epitomizes the national grief of the 1850s, and fans the fire of revenge. The dead body of the heroic László Hunyadi, son of the great János Hunyadi, lies in Buda Castle Chapel. King László V, fearing for throne, had lured the popular young Hunyadi to his place with a promise of safe passage. Then he seized him and had him beheaded in the market place at Buda on March 16, 1457.

One of the earlier examples of this new trend is Bartolomeo Manfredi's Tavern Scene with a Lute Player.

43540-anselmus.jpg,"Family harmony is a source of prosperity and happiness. So proclaims the Latin inscription in the cartouche at the top of the picture. This is the message of this family portrait, which does much more than simply depict wealthy members of Antwerp high society. Antonius Anselmus, an alderman of the city from 1580 to 1582, and his wife Joanna Hooftmans, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, are placed in front of a neutral background, accompanied by their two children, both born in Antwerp, Gillis in 1575 and Joanna in 1576. A third child was to be born in Hamburg, where the family sought refuge for a time after the city of Antwerp was returned to the Catholics. The Anselmus family, like the Hooftmans, were Calvinists.The family's high social ranking is immediately visible in the various items of decor: the carved furniture, the silver inkwell on the table, and the fragile Venetian glass vase, as well as the costly lace on the parents' garments and the children's aprons. The little girl holds a sumptuous vermeil rattle, a prestigious object symbolising the wealth of the newly born child. This object was offered to very young children by a godfather or an important person. The one represented here has at one end a whistle and at the other a wolf's tooth, to which popular belief attributed the double power of protecting children against the evil eye and reducing teething pain. On the table between the couple are the marriage gloves and a rose, symbols of the love that unites them. The children express the prosperity of the couple as does the fruit being held by the elder. At the same time the tame bird on his shoulder is a metaphor for a successful education.Maerten de Vos, who excelled in the portrait genre, was also known for his religious paintings, producing, among other works, six paintings of episodes from the life of St Paul for the dining room of Gillis Hooftmans, Joanna's father. It is possibly following this commission that he painted the family portrait. By creating a unified and enveloping space around the figures, the artist succeeded in given a new dimension to the genre, intensifying both the psychological study and the allegorical significance.

26350-portarti.jpg,"Dressed in their finery the couple sit side by side in a room, which is revealed by numerous items and the woman at the blackboard to be in a tavern. The man and his wife are illuminated by an unseen light source from the front left. The man is laughing and puts his left arm around the young woman's shoulders, a gesture echoed by her arm as she hands him some berries. He raises a flute glass in his right hand to her health, while she looks straight ahead rather stiffly. Beside the couple a table is laid with a silver pot, some dried fish and a small loaf of bread, but the way it has been truncated at one end gives it the look of a stage prop. The rear of the tavern is in shadow, so that all that may be distinguished is the incidental figure chalking up orders in front of the fireplace, a narrow shelf, and an empty birdcage hanging above. The room opens up to the rear at the right, giving a view of a sunny courtyard in which a market stall has been erected.Although the painting was for many years known simply as The Lovers at Breakfast, the two protagonists, quite different in type, have been identified as the artist and Isabella de Wolff, whom he married in 1658 and who was a niece of the painter Pieter de Grebber.The iconography of the painting distinguishes it as part of a painting tradition well-known to the educated contemporary viewer: the carousing, feasting couple, the ambience of the tavern with the landlady at the blackboard, the highly significant bread and fish still-life on the table. All of these elements point to the subject of the 'prodigal son regaling with the harlots in the inn'. This Biblical parable, much loved and widespread in seventeenth-century Dutch painting, was understood as an admonition against a life of sin and vice. A link between the Biblical story and an artist's self-portrait was not, however, completely unusual.

33608-13group.jpg,"Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Portrait'],['Dutch'],['Baroque'],a painting of a group of people sitting around a table,REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn,Sampling Officials of the Drapers' Guild,Images\33608-13group.jpg,"(10, 5, 5)",,"(45, 29, 17)",,0.6598210169491525,0.0152013559322033,0.2964935593220339,0.0284840677966101,"(10, 5, 5)","(45, 29, 17)",,

11367-5delaroc.jpg,"Anglomania was in fashion in France in the 1820s and 1830s. Interest in British history, fuelled by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, was further stimulated by parallels drawn between recent events in France and the turbulent accounts of Tudors, Stuarts and the Civil War. The pictorial representation of British history may have been pioneered in Britain, but it was the Frenchman Paul Delaroche who gained a European reputation with the grand scenes drawn from it which he exhibited at the annual Paris Salon between 1825 and 1835. Popularised through mass-produced engravings, these set pieces, combining ostentatious antiquarianism with the pseudo-realism of bourgeois melodrama, in turn influenced the painters of national history in mid-Victorian Britain.The painting depicts the last moments on 12 February 1554 in the life of the seventeen-year old Jane Grey, a great granddaughter of Henry VII who was proclaimed Queen of England upon the death of young King Edward VI, a Protestant like herself. She reigned for nine days in 1553, but, through the machinations of the partisans of Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor, she was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death in the Tower of London.Delaroche, who based the painting on a sixteenth-century Protestant martyrology, has falsified the historical account the better to appeal to his contemporaries. Lady Jane Grey, a humanist-educated young married woman, was in fact executed out of doors. Attended by two gentlewomen, probably no less stoical than she, she resolutely made her own way to the block. She could not have worn a white satin dress of nineteenth-century cut with a whalebone corset, and her hair would have been tucked up, not streaming down over her shoulders. But a painting cannot be judged by the criteria of historical accuracy. Much more applicable to this particular picture are the standards of popular melodrama and tableau vivant.As on a stage, the heroine gropes her way towards the audience, gently guided by the elderly Constable of the Tower whose massive, dark, male presence acts as a foil to her own. A spotlight trained on her from above complements the dim stage lighting, reflecting from her immaculate dress and the straw which spills over into the front row of the stalls.

The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. The shutters were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.Light is effectively rendered as an expressive device without becoming a particularly naturalistic component, striking here and there, helter-skelter, although a certain concentration on the left may be isolated. Highlights are also found on the right-hand edges of forms, especially in the canvas showing St George impaling the dragon. Color is equally antinaturalistic. The tight-fitting leather costume of the saint is outlined, pale maroon against a golden sky. His gray horse, ferociously participating in the confrontation, is accentuated by a calligraphic arrangement of thin red straps. There are strong echoes of Mantegna, perhaps in part filtered through Squarcione, in motives like the rendering of the winding trail with figures on the hill behind the princess and a tight application of paint, which permits abundant minuscule detail.

Indeed, the influence of that painting can be traced for many years afterwards in Delacroix's work, for example, in his Christ on the Lake of Gennesaret (1854) or The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840). The 'stage-setting' of The Barque of Dante looks forward to Baudelaire's pronouncement that Delacroix is an 'essentially literary' painter. But Delacroix had something much more important to leam from the Raft. In expressing the predicament of the shipwrecked everywhere in the world, Géricault had laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution. The Raft of the Medusa marks the first appearance in painting of 'the ugly' and thereby proclaims its scrupulous respect for the truth, however repulsive the truth might be.

38632-bp_advic.jpg,"""This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his """"Die Wahlverwandtschaften"""" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs.

09530-selfport.jpg,"Occasionally a painting contains extra information, about the scene itself, for example, or about the artist. This self-portrait by the Amsterdam painter Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen tells us important facts about his life. The note with the date 1533 and the house mark between an I and an A appear to announce that Iacobus Amstelodamensis, or Jacob of Amsterdam, painted this portrait of himself in 1533. It is known from the archives that Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, the person behind the name Jacob of Amsterdam, must have died before 18 October 1533, the date of a document stating that his wife was a widow. That and the date on the Self-Portrait appear to be conclusive evidence that the artist did indeed die that year.However, it has been suggested that he was dead by 1532, when one of his houses was sold. So 1533 or 1532 - it is not known for sure. On top of that, there are doubts about when the Self-portrait was actually executed. It is very close in style to the paintings that Jacob Cornelisz made around 1525, and he is not known to have made any more after 1526. It is possible that the date was added later, in the year of his death, and that we are looking at a Van Oostsanen who is younger than he appeared in 1533.There is another panel in which the same man is seated before an easel, painting the portrait of an older woman. It is by Dirck Jacobsz, the couple's son, who traced the head in the Rijksmuseum Self-Portrait and used it for the man by the easel.

41294-10ladisl.jpg,"Of the Hungarian kings St Ladislas is perhaps the one most often represented in post-medieval frescoes, altar paintings and statues. In the Middle Ages he was associated with the ideal of chivalry and the legends which gathered around him determined the manner of his representation. Thus the knightly armour and the battle-axe have become permanent attributes, in addition to the crown and the orb.The painting illustrated here, dating from the late sixteenth century, is only superficially linked with medieval portraits of St. Ladislas. The king is shown seated on a throne wearing an ample, richly embroidered cloak studded with pearls round the hem. In the foreground is a voluted and foiled shield with the national emblem, stylized in harmony with the throne. The background is designed to suggest the interior of a Renaissance palace. Through opening on either side of the wall behind the throne - draped with embroidered hangings - there is a view of landscape. A similar motif was often used to fill in the background in north Italian Madonna paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The monochrome landscape on the left is a topographic reference to one of St. Ladislas' most important church activities, the foundation of the Cathedral in Nagyvárad, while the one on the right shows his legendary defeat of the Cumanian abductor. This evocation of two popular episodes from the story of the king's life is intended partly to identify St. Ladislas as a rule of worldly power, and partly to indicate the ideal unity of the Christian king and the Christian knight.St Ladislas is shown as a historical personage, without a halo - a fact indicating that the painting was destined for a secular building. The episodes from the king's life or, to be mere accurate, from legends associated with his name, are treated as historical facts. The same approach characterized the series of prints of royalty and other notabilities which became so popular all Europe in the course of the sixteenth century. It may be assumed that such prints served as models for the painted portrait of St. Ladislas and the two related pictures of St. Stephen and St Emeric","['Oil', 'wood']",['Unknown'],['Religious'],['Hungarian'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a man sitting in a chair,"UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian","Saint Ladislaus, King of Hungary",Images\41294-10ladisl.jpg,"(68, 49, 44)",,,"(138, 82, 60)",0.5125854263273937,0.1431023389748056,0.0703183234077945,0.2739939112900062,"(68, 49, 44)","(138, 82, 60)",,

43965-2tripti1.jpg,"""The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier. Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck. It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier. Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background. This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or """"Chinese apple"""", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors. Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the """"devotio moderna"""". This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life. In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him.

The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character.

10630-riverban.jpg,"Cuyp's earliest dated landscapes of 1639 are astonishingly eclectic, but by 1641 he was painting panoramic views of the Dutch countryside in the monochromatic mode of van Goyen. The young Cuyp, however, favoured a distinct yellow tonality as against van Goyen greyish and brown hues. More important for Cuyp's subsequent development was the impact of Dutch landscapists who brought an Italianate style from Rome back to Holland; Cuyp himself never travelled to the south.Since very few of Cuyp's landscapes are dated, and none is dated after 1645, it is difficult to say precisely when the characteristic golden light, reminiscent of the Campagna the artist never saw, replaces the earlier paler one, and when mountain ranges, herds of cattle, and figures conspicuously set off against a sky begin to play an important role in his compositions. But by 1645 distinct traces of the style of Cornelis Poelenburgh, a member of the first generation of Italianate painters, and Jan Both, the leading artist of the following generation of Italianate landscapists, are evident. Jan Both became Cuyp's principal source of inspiration. The River-bank with Cows shows how rapidly he assimilated Both's motifs and sun-drenched light. From this time onward golden sunlight becomes the all-pervading element in Cuyp's paintings.

11939-sopron.jpg,"""The altarpiece of St. George church in Sopron is one of those rare Baroque compositions which are not a simple devotional picture or a copy of one, but a so-called picture in picture. This type of composition, apart from intensifying the pictorial effect, always refers to some important aspects of the history of devotion of the central picture.In the middle of this altarpieces, in an elegant Louis XIV. style golden frame set out whit laurel festoons and bows of ribbons, is shown the image of the Virgin of Genazzano, at that time famous all over the world, with her special appellation written in a banderole: Maria von guten, Rath, Mother of Good Advice (Aurenhammer 1956. 110-111).The prototype of the Eleousa-type devotional picture was an Albanian Treccento fresco from the church of Skutari, delivered from the Turkish invaders in 1467 the Augustinian hermits in Genazzano near Roma. Its veneration spread by means of copies made for other churches of the order, and won popularity through the pious brotherhoods founded for its honour. The cult of the Mother of Good Advice - obviously because of its anti-Islamic aspects - was encouraged by Pope Innocent XI, so in the 17th and 18th centuries it flourished not only within the order but throughout the whole Catholic Church.In Hungary the altarpieces representing the Mother of Good Advice sometimes also show the angels who, according to the legend, flew with the devotional picture and brought it to its place.The representation of this scene may come from a copperplate of Sebestyén Zeller, an engraver in Pozsony. In Sopron, however, the substitution of this usual environment for an allegorical natural landscape transmits an entirely original, thus far unknown  meaning of the iconography of the picture. The tree struck by lightning and the shattered ancient idol with lire, in his hand had already lost much of their topicallity at the time as symbols for the enemies of the pervious centuries (pagans, Turks, the Reformation). The literary products of the Enlightenment which spread even by way of leaflets, engendered a grave spiritual crisis, disrupting even the traditional unity of the clergy. The verse of psalm written in front of the flashing thunderbolts at the two sides of the picture: Verstummen müssen - falsche Lettzen, Ps. 30. v. 19. (Let the lying lips be put to silence, Psalm 31, 18) gives us a very perceptible rendering of the mood of the belivers confused in their traditional religiosity. With the dark clouds in the background Dorffmaister presents us with a picturesque and inventive representation of the shock that befell the faith before omnipotence of reason, and makes us feel the atmosphere of the crisis caused in many contemporaries by awareness of helplessness.It is in this stormy, almost pre-Romantic landscape in this """"mirror of the soul"""" that the gentle look of the Mother of Good Advice and that of the Child on her breast might have been an """"apology"""" of orientation and inner satisfaction for everybody having recourse to her""","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Religious'],['Hungarian'],"['Rococo', 'Neoclassicism']",a painting of the virgin and angels,"DORFFMEISTER, István",The Mother of Good Advice,Images\11939-sopron.jpg,"(52, 39, 33)",,"(103, 69, 56)",,0.4768040402732364,0.1013251750892982,0.2834558149071406,0.1384149697303247,"(52, 39, 33)","(103, 69, 56)",,
03914-207feas.jpg,"""The Feast of the Gods was Giovanni Bellini's last great  painting and one of only a few that he executed on canvas. It was the first in a series of mythologies or bacchanals commissioned by Duke Alfonso d'Este to decorate the camerino d'alabastro, or alabaster study, of his castle in Ferrara. The artist, whose career began in the 1450s, was trained to paint on wooden panels, which require a very meticulous application of pigment. When he worked on canvas late in his career, Bellini retained his tight, precise brushwork. The flesh tones, iridescent silks, and even the foreground pebbles here demonstrate his delicate touch.According to the current interpretations, the scene illustrates a passage from Ovid's Fasti (The Feasts), a long classical poem that recounts the origins of many  ancient Roman rites and festivals. Ovid (43 B.C. - A.D. 17), describing a banquet given by the god of wine, mentioned an incident that embarrassed Priapus, god of  virility.The beautiful nymph Lotis, shown reclining at the far right, was lulled to sleep by wine. Priapus, overcome by lust, seized the opportunity to take advantage of her and is portrayed bending forward to lift her skirt. His attempt was foiled when an ass, seen at the left, """"with raucous braying, gave out an ill-timed roar. Awakened, the startled nymph pushed Priapus away, and the god was laughed at by all."""" Priapus, his pride wounded, took revenge by demanding the annual sacrifice of a donkey.The ass stands next to Silenus, a woodland deity who used the beast to carry wood, thus wears a keg on his belt because he was a follower of Bacchus, god of wine. Bacchus himself, seen as an infant, kneels before them while decanting wine into a crystal pitcher.Reading from left to right, the principal figures are:Silenus, a woodland god attended by his donkeyBacchus, the infant god of wine crowned with grape leavesFaunus or Silvanus, an old forest god wearing a wreath of pine needlesMercury, the messenger of the gods carrying his caduceus or herald's staffJupiter, the king of the gods accompanied by an eagleAn unidentified goddess holding a quince, a fruit associated in the ancient world with marriagePan, a satyr with a grape wreath who blows on his shepherd's pipesNeptune, the god of the sea sitting beside his trident harpoonCeres, the goddess of cereal grains with a wreath of wheatApollo, god of the sun and the arts, crowned by laurel and holding a Renaissance stringed musical instrument, the lira da braccio, in lieu of a classical lyrePriapus, the god of virility and of vineyards with a scythe, used to prune orchards, hanging from the tree above himLotis, one of the naiads, a nymph of fresh waters who represents chastity.These deities are waited upon by three naiads, nymphs of streams and brooks, and two satyrs, goat-footed inhabitants of the wilderness.

The stiff, marionette-like figures with heavily drawn features; the hard, richly contrasted palette; and the systematic use in his landscapes of stereotypical vegetation and towers or city views in the distance are typical of nearly all his compositions.In this St Sebastian all these elements are clearly visible. The physiognomy with the heavy nose and the rather oriental eyes with large, vaulted upper eyelids and bushy eyebrows is to be seen in several of his works, for example, the Lamentation in Minneapolis and in the Tallinn altarpiece. The flat folds of the loincloth can be compared with the Virgin's head-scarf in the Lamentation of the Thyssen Foundation, where Christ's torso has been modelled in much the same way. The manner in which the vegetation is treated is almost identical in the St John on Patmos of Rotterdam and in the Legend of St Lucy in St James' Church in Bruges.Owing to its small format, it can be suspected that the St Sebastian was the wing of a triptych.

13024-stuarts.jpg,"Early in 1639 the two Stuart brothers, cousins of King Charles I and younger sons of the third Duke of Lennox, set off on a three-year tour of the Continent. They must have posed for Van Dyck just before their departure. Since his arrival at the court, the artist had developed a new portrait type: the double portrait recording friendship, often, but not necessarily, between relatives. The two brothers are shown as if poised on the point of departure, waiting perhaps for servants to bring up their carriage. Both were to die a few years later in the Civil War, and hindsight gives the image an added valedictory poignancy.Van Dyck's compositional skill is surpassed only by his matchless ability to depict satin, lace and meltingly-soft kid leather. But these carefully described effects are somehow not local: the whole surface of the canvas is brought alive with a flickering touch. The costumes, so fashionably similar, are beautifully contrasted - receding warm gold and brown on Lord John, cooler and advancing silver and blue on Lord Bernard - so that the two brothers, complementing each other in apparel, seem to form one shimmering, indivisible whole","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['Flemish'],['Baroque'],a painting of two men in a room,"DYCK, Sir Anthony van",Lord John and Lord Bernard Stuart,Images\13024-stuarts.jpg,"(26, 21, 13)",,,"(106, 79, 53)",0.4615528496108461,0.164101180015064,0.0964900828521215,0.2778558875219684,"(26, 21, 13)","(106, 79, 53)",,

I am in the middle, painting. On the right are... friends... On the left, the other world of trivial life...""""In 1854, Courbet began work on The Studio which he would like to submit for the Exposition universelle. Courbet described the painting in a letter: """"I see society with its concerns and passions; it is the world that comes to be painted.... The scene takes place in my atelier in Paris. The painting is divided into two parts. I am in the middle, painting. On the right are the shareholders, that is, friends, workers, devotees of the art world. On the left, the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.""""The Studio presents a completely original synthesis and a thoroughly unexpected confrontation. There is no parallel in Courbet's later career for this generous, indeed baroque, vision, in which models and minds come together. Courbet sought to present the studio as an overall image of the role of art. He declared the autonomy and subjectivity of his perception in the face of history and the real world, both of which he had in his own way summoned into the studio. The master of ceremonies is seen painting a landscape, a practice that was to become increasingly central during the rest of his life. Meanwhile, the notion of a group portrait as homage or allegory in the spirit of Frans Hals, Rembrandt or Philippe de Champaigne, is perfectly achieved.The painting was a success at the Exposition, however, it did not find a buyer, remaining rolled up in a corner of the rue Hautefeuille studio till 1881, when Courbet's sister Juliette, his sole heir, decided to sell it. By then it had become something of a burden. It raised 21,000 francs (some 3,200 euros).

The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world.

43366-sacra_co.jpg,"The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date.

The second, on 6 June 1845, was in early Georgian dress and the third, on 13 June 1851, in the style of the Restoration.Landseer has painted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Throne Room on the occasion of the fancy-dress ball of 1842, standing beneath a specially designed Gothic canopy decorated with purple velvet hangings. Two chairs of state are visible behind the figures and above their heads on the cloth of honour is emblazoned the coat-of-arms of Edward III, combining French and English quarterings. It was from this alcove that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert greeted over 2,000 guests. Members of the Royal Household were expected to appear in costumes dating in style from the reign of Edward III, while the guests were encouraged to wear costumes of any period or country. The setting for the ball and the design of the costumes were entrusted to James Robinson Planche, who was an authority on the history of dress, as evidenced by his encyclopaedic book History of British Costume (1834), as well as a dramatist and a herald in the College of Arms.The costumes worn by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were designed by Vouillon and Laure with the guidance of Planche. For the sake of accuracy reference was made to the relevant monuments in Westminster Abbey. The queen's costume was based upon the effigies of Philippa of Hainault and her daughter Blanche de la Tour (died in infancy 1342), while that for Prince Albert was derived from the effigy of Edward III. Landseer began his painting at the time of the ball, but, as was so often the case with this artist, progress was delayed and the picture was not finished until 1846.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Historical'],['English'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a man in a red robe and a woman in a gold dress,"LANDSEER, Sir Edwin Henry",Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at the Bal Costumé of 12 May 1842,Images\21468-queen.jpg,"(8, 12, 17)","(139, 78, 62)",,"(55, 40, 47)",0.4369912403219302,0.2145182335507474,0.073351707768837,0.2751388183584853,"(8, 12, 17)","(55, 40, 47)","(139, 78, 62)",

On the one hand, Flemish artists of the 18th century continued to live off the inheritance of Rubens, whose art seemed unsurpassable. Artists such as Pieter Jozef Verhaghen worked entirely in the tradition of Rubens, and although he spent a few years in Italy, there are few traces of this in his work. His Hagar and Ishmael banished by Abraham, painted for the abbey at Tongerlo, has all the outward characteristics of a baroque painting, but lacks Rubens expressiveness.

Onbijt(je) was a light meal which could be taken at any time of the day.

A relatively high viewpoint was also chosen, apparently to afford a good overall survey of the objects, which are arranged side by side, or in a circle, hardly ever touching or overlapping. The precious drinking vessels and pieces of textile show very clearly that the arrangement is that of a privileged household.In accordance with etiquette, fruit, pies, nuts and confectionery were served as a dessert. Cheese, which had a central role in Gillis's and van Dijck's art, was also part of the dessert. Gillis and van Dijck build up pyramids of hard cheese in two or three layers: at the bottom there is half a large cheese with a rich, yellow hue, indicating that it is still very young, while on the top the cheeses are smaller and more brownish, almost grey in colour, showing that they are older and more mature.

44473-catherin.jpg,"Legend has it that in the reign of the Emperor Maxentius there lived a girl known as Catherine of Alexandria who was as intelligent and wise in debate as she was beautiful to look upon. During the last years of pagan Rome she emerged victorious from every verbal encounter with the Roman sages and it was for this reason that, at the Emperor's order, on the 25th of November, in the year 307 A.D., she was broken on the wheel and then beheaded. Catherine's emblems are therefore the wheel, the sword, the palm-branch and the book, the first two representing her martyrdom, the others her wisdom.Both her life and her death were favourite subjects for paintings in the Middle Ages, chosen even by the greatest artists of the Renaissance when it was only possible to paint a beautiful woman in the guise of a saint.

Albrecht Dürer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike Dürer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop.

13403-15arnol.jpg,"""""""The Arnolfini Marriage"""" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's """"Jewish Bride"""", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him""","['Oil', 'oak']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['Flemish'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a woman in a green dress and a man in a black hat,"EYCK, Jan van",Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife,Images\13403-15arnol.jpg,"(81, 60, 19)","(43, 36, 15)",,,0.4172260223048327,0.4157858736059479,0.1278602230483271,0.0391278810408921,"(81, 60, 19)","(43, 36, 15)",,

14084-chevalie.jpg,"This is the leftt wing of a diptych, originally located in Melun. The right wing showing the Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels is in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp.Estienne Chevalier, who came from Melun, was French Ambassador to England in 1445 and six years later became Treasurer to Charles VII of France. He presented the diptych of which this panel forms the left wing, to his native town; on this wing he had himself painted next to his patron saint, Stephen. The saint, wearing a deacon's robe, is holding a book, on which a jagged stone is lying, as a symbol of his martyrdom. The formal architecture in the background is in the Italian Renaissance style showing pilasters with coloured inlaid marble panels between them. On the wall, receding in perspective, the name Estienne Chevalier is inscribed several times. Originally the donor and the saint were looking towards the Madonna, who occupied the right wing of the diptych; this panel found its way into the Antwerp Museum.According to a description of the paintings by Denis Godefroy in 1661, the original frames were covered in blue velvet. Round each picture were strands of gold and silver thread, in which the donor's initials were woven in pearls. There were also gilded medallions on which stories of the saints were represented.Tradition has it - and there is considerable supporting evidence - that the Madonna's features are those of Agnes Sorel, the beautiful and influential mistress of Charles VII. Known portraits of her certainly do not conflict with this hypothesis. Her relationship with Estienne Chevalier was not entirely political, and an eighteenth-century inscription on the back of the Antwerp panel tells us that the diptych of Melun was endowed by Estienne following a vow he made on her death in 1450. The diptych was in the chancel of the Church of Notre-Dame at Melun, south of Paris, from 1461 until about 1775, when the two halves became separated.The date of Agnes Sorel's death is not the only reason for assuming that the diptych was painted around 1450. At any later period the cut of Estienne's robe would no longer have been in fashion. A few years earlier, between 1443 and 1447, Fouquet had been in Italy and the background of the Berlin panel is clearly the result of what he saw there. After returning from the south, he settled in his birthplace, Tours. From then on he worked for Charles VII and the court and became the leading exponent of the French Court style",['Wood'],['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['French'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a man holding a box,"FOUQUET, Jean",Melun Diptych: Estienne Chevalier with St Stephen,Images\14084-chevalie.jpg,"(35, 17, 23)","(150, 123, 101)",,"(108, 55, 46)",0.4017214576962283,0.2178924566768603,0.1347145769622834,0.2456715086646279,"(35, 17, 23)","(108, 55, 46)","(150, 123, 101)",

De Ruyter was born in Flushing port in 1607, and first went to sea when he was only eleven years old. His navigating skills brought him rapid advancement. De Ruyter was employed by the Admiralty, in Zeeland in 1652 and in Amsterdam a year later. As vice-admiral of the fleet he took part in the numerous sea battles the Dutch fought against England. In 1665 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet. He won a number of victories, but the pinnacle of his career was undoubtedly the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672-1674), in which his superior tactics enabled him to keep a large Anglo-French fleet away from the Dutch coast. De Ruyter was killed at Syracuse in 1676, and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam.This pen drawing by Willem van de Velde depicts the council of war on the eve of the four-day naval battle during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667).

26106-28jerome.jpg,"The legend of this fourth-century doctor of the Church only began to take shape in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting. Small, transparent droplets of blood well up from his bruised chest. His scarlet cardinal's cloak and hat lie on the ground behind him, as if he had just cast them off. The lion lies down faithfully beside him. The scene is enacted on a rocky plateau before a cave, which is the hermit's retreat.This fairly large panel is not very well known, and is sometimes treated with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, it is a fine example in every respect of Memling's vision and technique. Monumentally conceived, yet executed with an undramatically fresh and guileless realism, this St Jerome is one of the most elegant large figures in the artist's oeuvre. The spatial character of the slim, half-naked saint is comparable with the Stuttgart Bathsheba. The extremely free underdrawing, the elongated body shapes and a physiognomy that seems to prefigure that of Van Cleve or Massys suggest that both paintings were executed fairly late, although additional evidence would be required for more precise dating. A characteristic Memling trait is the way the emblematic attributes such as the crucifix, the lion and the cardinal's clothes are included in a natural manner. Taken together, it is like a moment from a story, despite the fact that the depicted elements refer to different periods of the saint's life. Furthermore, the crucifix consists of a genuine flesh-and-blood little body, put to death in miniature, with no attempt on the artist's part to portray it as a vision.We do not know whether the panel was autonomous, or whether it had wings or a companion piece.

The subjects of the paintings of the retable are not recorded, but it is assumed that they illustrated the Life of Christ. For reasons of size, style, and subject matter, the following paintings probably came from the retable: the Annunciation, the widest painting, in the centre (the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation); the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ, two paintings of the same size, on the left and right of the Annunciation; the Crucifixion above the Annunciation; and the Resurrection and Pentecost, another pair of identical size, flanking the Crucifixion (the whole forming a retable of a type known in the Escorial). Such an arrangement gives a chronological sequence to the events of the Life of Christ. The payment of 6000 ducados (for the paintings and retable) indicate a large commission. Small versions, probably models, exist for the three paintings more generally accepted as belonging to the retable, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ.Probably originally on the right of the retable of the Colegio de Do&#241;a María, balancing the Adoration of the Shepherds, and painted at the same time. A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome. A later development of this subject, only treated once before, in the Modena Triptych, is the painting for the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, Toledo, probably completed after his death by Jorge Manuel. The pose of the Christ is related to that of the Saint Sebastian of c. 1580. The bipartite composition can be related to the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, the portraits giving place to the range of angels. The splendid ecstatic figure of the angel, between the Baptist and Christ, is one of a number of such symbols that he began to introduce into his painting.

The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground.

04123-peasants.jpg,"Nicolaes Berchem, the son of a distinguished still-life painter, Pieter Claesz., was born in Haarlem. The town was a leading centre of landscape painting in the early seventeenth century and among Berchem's teachers was the landscapist Jan van Goyen. Like many Dutch artists, Berchem travelled to Italy immediately after completing his apprenticeship. He was in Rome late in 1642 and remained there for three years. While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes. As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments. These buildings cannot be identified, as they are only loosely modelled on actual ruins. Berchem uses a bright, highly-coloured palette and applies the paint in short, stabbing brush strokes.In seventeenth-century Holland there was a constant demand for exotic landscapes of this type and Berchem was a highly successful artist. He moved to Amsterdam, which had a larger art market than Haarlem, in about 1677. His work was widely imitated and copied during his lifetime and his paintings enthusiastically sought after in France in the eighteenth century and in England in the nineteenth. This painting, having been in the distinguished Amsterdam collection of Gerrit Braamcamp in the mid-eighteenth century, was bought in Paris by the Duc de Chabot in 1780 and in London in 1840 by Sir Robert Peel","['Oil', 'wood']",['Horizontal'],['Landscape'],['Dutch'],['Baroque'],a painting of cattle and cattle in a rocky landscape,"BERCHEM, Nicolaes",Peasants with Cattle by a Ruined Aqueduct,Images\04123-peasants.jpg,"(61, 37, 30)","(231, 215, 189)",,,0.3599935161214964,0.2691429361480994,0.1724771276418229,0.1983864200885812,"(61, 37, 30)","(231, 215, 189)",,

They had been concealed under old coats of paint for centuries. Villa Lemmi belonged to the Tornabuoni family, friend of the Medici. It is possible that the frescoes were commissioned on the occasion of a marriage between members of the Tornabuoni and Albizzi families. For a long time the view was held that the couple in question were Giovanna degli Albizzi and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who married in 1486. This assumption has, however, since been proven wrong, for the face of Giovanna that we know from a medallion does not agree with the lady in Botticell's fresco. A possible alternative could be Nanna Tornabuoni and Matteo degli Albizzi, who married in about 1484.It is supposed the frescoes were executed to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi.The frescoes are in a very poor state of preservation, because they were damaged when taken down from the wall. Two of the three fragments found were transferred to canvas and later sold to the Louvre in Paris.

21141-view_squ.jpg,"K&#248;bke is one of the most distinguished of the so-called painters of the Danish Golden Age, whose work represents a brilliant contribution to nineteenth- century European art. He started training as an artist at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen in 1822, and from 1828 became a student of C.W. Eckersberg. K&#248;bke usually painted small-scale pictures of great precision - landscapes, studies of architectural subjects and portraits of his family and friends. Whatever the subject, he invariably combined carefully observed, often richly coloured naturalistic details, with a sense of controlled abstract design.This painting was made in about 1830, when he was developing his mature style, and shows the bakery in the Kastel, which is a castle in Copenhagen that served as a prison. The three figures in the foreground are K&#248;bke's father, who owned the bakery, Major J.J. Krohn, and the slave Sergeant Sporch (the prisoners were described as 'slaves'). The scene was one with which K&#248;bke was very familiar as he lived within the castle compound from 1817 to 1834. In the later 1830s his family moved out of Copenhagen and he concentrated on depicting more rural scenes; subsequent visits to Germany and Italy broadened the scope of his subject matter still further","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Landscape'],['Danish'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a street scene with a man and woman walking,"K?BKE, Christen",A View of the Square in the Kastel Looking Towards the Ramparts,Images\21141-view_squ.jpg,"(44, 20, 16)",,,"(88, 58, 44)",0.3546159491193738,0.1777348336594912,0.1386619373776908,0.3289872798434442,"(44, 20, 16)","(88, 58, 44)",,
38536-2allegor.jpg,"Abraham van den Tempel painted a series of three allegorical history pieces for the governors of the Lakenhal, or Clothmakers' Hall in Leiden between 1648 and 1651. The commission was a prestigious one, not only because of the size of the pictures, but also because they were history pieces to be displayed in a high ranking public building. The governors who commissioned the work were men of considerable stature, too. They were entrusted by the city fathers with the day-to-day management of one of Leiden's nine textile sectors, known in Dutch as 'neringen'. In this capacity they were responsible for the manufacture of and trade in worsted, a sector that was booming at the time. Their seat of office was the brand-new building which has been known to this day as the Lakenhal. They wanted classicist decorations worthy of their modern building.Regarding the series, Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden originally served as the overmantel, while the other two, Mars Banishes 'Nering' and The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' hung on the long wall beside one another. The latter two paintings form pendants, being the same size and related in subject-matter. The theme that connects them is 'nering', the term formerly used in Leiden for the production of and trade in textile.Whereas the Mars Banishes 'Nering' illustrates the misfortune caused by war, the painting The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' embodies the antithesis, where freedom, justice and peace foster trade and industry. Here Minerva and Mercury return as witnesses of the principal scene in which the Maid of Leiden stands on a step in her purple gown and crimson mantel and extends a hand to Nering, while Liberty, with her broken weapons and the hat symbolising freedom, kneels at her feet.

05801-1simon.jpg,"Dirk Bouts came from Haarlem, where he doubtless received his early training. Later he settled in the university city of Louvain, where his major work can still be seen in the Church of St Peter. When he was appointed City Painter in 1468, he was already over fifty years old. The Berlin panel, as its close likeness to the work of Aelbert Ouwater suggests, must have been one of his earlier works.The story of Jesus's visit to the house of Simon the Pharisee is told in St Luke's Gospel (vii, 36-50). A woman from the city followed Christ there, 'and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.' Simon condemned the attitude of his guest, saying : 'This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.' Christ answered with a parable and the words: 'Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.'In a narrow, vaulted room, on the left of which is a window providing a glimpse of a landscape, Simon sits with his guests at a table laid for a meal. On the left of the table the sinner bends down to anoint Jesus's feet. The host, the only one present wearing shoes, and Peter beside him, observe the incident with astonishment and disapproval. The youthful John at the head of the table seems to be drawing the attention of the donor, a Dominican monk, to it. The latter kneels with hands raised in prayer and, as if he dare not look, averts his gaze.The arrangement of the figures at a laid table recalls two other themes from the life of Christ, the Last Supper and the Miracle at Emmaus, incidents which were frequently represented in painting and, furthermore, established a pictorial tradition of their own. Here the table is laid with bread, wine and fish, the last of these being an ancient Christian symbol. The composition of the various objects represents one of the most delightful still-lifes in old Netherlandish painting.

However, it turned out that the frescoes are the early works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Obvious stylistic and iconographic similarities between these frescoes and other early Tiepolo works were pointed out.The work at the Villa Baglioni began immediately after the wealthy Venetian publisher Giambattista Baglioni acquired in 1718 the seventeenth-century villa in Massanzago. The frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main hall, illusionistically breaking through the walls and creating a boundless space, thanks to the faux architectural structure conceived by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, who henceforth would be Tiepolo's most frequent collaborator, working on almost all of his large-scale decorative projects in Venice and the Veneto.The theme of the frescoes is the Myth of Phaethon, based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. The principal episode, Phaethon Asking His Father to Let Him Drive the Chariot of Sun, is staged on the east wall. The opposite wall is divided into two parts by the doors that lead into the hall from the monumental staircase. The right portion of the wall contains the Fall of Phaethon, the left part shows the Heliads, sisters of Phaethon.

Canaletto and his artist nephew Bellotto are recorded as having sold some of their works at one of these exhibitions.

They are, from left to right: Secretaries, who wear mauve; the Doge's chair- and cushion-bearers; the Cancelliere Grande who wears scarlet; the Doge himself in gold and ermine; the Guardiano Grande di San Rocco; the bearer of the sword of state; the Senators; and finally the Ambassadors. A number of them carry nosegays, which were presented as reminders of the plague; they were carried during outbreaks of the disease because it was believed that their scent helped prevent its spread.Canaletto shows an expansive view of this scene which could not, in fact, be observed, because the church of the Frari impinges too far on the near side of the square.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],['Rococo'],a painting of a street scene with people and buildings,CANALETTO,The Feast Day of St Roch,Images\07213-canal501.jpg,"(54, 36, 30)","(175, 192, 214)","(100, 80, 70)",,0.3423566184860676,0.2563212997223013,0.242464569695198,0.158857512096433,"(54, 36, 30)","(175, 192, 214)","(100, 80, 70)",

Cimabue, who came from Florence, is the first of the mural painters active in Assisi who can be identified by name. The subject matter of the extensive pictorial program that was executed under Cimabue's direction in the transept and the apse is based for the most part on the dedications of the altars in the western section of the church. A thirteenth-century inscription indicates that the altar in the south transept was dedicated to the archangel Michael; the high altar, to the birth of the Virgin; and the altar in the north transept, to the apostles or to Peter and Paul. Accordingly, the apse had scenes from the life of the Virgin, culminating in the Assumption; the south transept had motifs from the Apocalypse and a large Crucifixion on the east wall; the north transept arm had scenes from the lives of the apostles and another large Crucifixion; and the crossing vault had the evangelists.The scenes from the life of the Virgin in the apse of the Upper Church represent the first large program dedicated to Mary in the history of Italian painting. The paintings of the upper registers are almost entirely destroyed. The four large fields of the basamento to the left and right of the papal throne are dedicated to the death and glorification of the Virgin. The Assembly of the Apostles by the Virgin's Deathbed is followed by the Death of the Virgin and the Assumption.

35820-ferrybo.jpg,"With far-reaching stylistic similarities in their monochromatic, tonal treatment of the subject, Salomon van Ruysdael's river landscapes and those of Jan van Goyen from the 1630s are almost indistinguishable. However, around 1645 the first-named artist discovered the pictorial possibilities of the tree motif in compositions, through the work of his much more famous nephew Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael, in which this element plays a key role. This gave his variations on the theme a new impulse, and between 1645 and 1655 he painted a series of peaceful, limpid views with which he reached the summit of his art. With the cautious expansion of his palette and the more self confident style typical of these years, his work is also much more distinctively his own.The compositional structure to which this landscape owes its attractiveness is of a bold simplicity. A quarter of the way up the picture the horizontal axis intersects a vertical axis provided by the dark silhouette of a group of trees rising up on the opposite river bank. This divides the picture into two zones, of almost identical size, but in formal contrast to each other. In the left half each individual motif, under a highly atmospheric sky, bathes in an aura of lightness and weightlessness, contrasting with the right half, where mass and volume are piled up in the form of a farmstead, overshadowed by the tree group. Within this constellation even the ferry in the left foreground, laden low with a four-in-hand and a large number of passengers, appears like a fallen leaf carried along effortlessly by the river, the connecting feature stretching through this landscape.Within Salomon van Ruysdael's work, catalogued by Wolfgang Stechow, this painting represents an exception from his otherwise typical use of diagonals in his compositions. But whenever in later works he returns to this traditional pattern, this Ferryboat appears to have been a key work for the discovery of new waterside motifs, providing the viewer with variety and entertainment during his visual walk along never-ending river banks","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Unknown'],['Landscape'],['Dutch'],['Baroque'],a painting of a river with boats and people on it,"RUYSDAEL, Salomon van",The Ferryboat,Images\35820-ferrybo.jpg,"(49, 41, 34)","(183, 165, 133)",,"(227, 214, 177)",0.3403723887375113,0.2364598056215302,0.1257959463200687,0.2973718593208896,"(49, 41, 34)","(227, 214, 177)","(183, 165, 133)",

38600-kermis.jpg,"Depictions of the 'kermis' or rural fair belong to an iconographic and compositional tradition founded in the Netherlands in about 1550 by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. So when David Teniers painted his first country fair in i637, his native town of Antwerp could already look back on an almost century-long tradition in this genre.The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn shown here demonstrates how Teniers had grown away from Adriaen Brouwer and developed his own style, distinguished primarily by a lighter overall tone and warmer, more radiant colours. The scale of his figures is somewhat reduced in his village scenes, so that they fit more convincingly into his broad, expansive landscapes with their subtly shaded atmospheres. The festivities are being held here in a square, bounded on two sides by a wooden fence, in front of a village tavern similar to that in many other Flemish kermis paintings. A path leads off to the left in the direction of Antwerp Cathedral, which gives the rural festivities a local and municipal frame of reference. The sky, with its vivid stretches of cloud and the gold-tinged light of the evening on the left, is given a special weight, which lends the scene a cool, airy atmosphere and a festive mood.The joyful, lively antics of the farmers are not based on Teniers's own observations, but are pieced together from the handed-down repertoire of motifs for this genre, which were constantly varied and modified. They include the musicians standing on their podium, the three couples doing a round dance in the foreground, the drunk who is being helped home by two farmers, and the man who is leaning by the fence in an attack of nausea. At the end of the canvas on the right edge we also see the motif of the 'unequal couple': Teniers had already used lecherous old farmers hugging young girls as a single motif for a painting","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Genre'],['Flemish'],['Baroque'],a painting of a village scene,"TENIERS, David the Younger",The Kermis at the Half Moon Inn,Images\38600-kermis.jpg,"(32, 26, 27)","(156, 149, 169)",,"(101, 86, 80)",0.3349220867208672,0.2669336043360433,0.194010162601626,0.2041341463414634,"(32, 26, 27)","(156, 149, 169)","(101, 86, 80)",

It was this painting that inspired Cardinal Scipione to commission a large marble group on the same subject from Gian Lorenzo Bernini (also in the Borghese Gallery). The myth of Aeneas, ancestor of Romulus and Remus, referred to the birth of Rome and thus confirmed the Borghese family's high status in the city.Barrocci's many drawings of nature led him to achieve a spontaneity and naturalness in movement, colour and airy effects, and a silvery luminosity that was to influence the 17th-century masters, particularly Rubens. Never before had flames been painted so close to, with an energy suggesting even the crackle of the fire, from which Ascanius seems to be protecting himself by covering his ears.

Love is impossible without food and drink. Rather than depicting a boisterous feast, Rubens has opted for a rather restrained scene that must be read as a plea for moderation in pleasure.Rubens produced this painting a few years after his eight-year stay in Italy, where he was employed at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, and also in Rome. The knowledge of antiquity he gained then was put to use in this painting, as also in a later work on the same theme in 1614, (Royal Fine Arts Museum, Antwerp), Ceres' pose being taken from the Crouching Venus of the Hellenistic sculptor Doidalsas, dating from around 240-230 BC. Rubens certainly knew the marble copy in the Farnese collection in Rome (today in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples).What he particularly appreciated in Hellenistic and Roman sculpture was its formal dynamism, although he saw in ancient sculpture generally a realm of flawless, ideal nature. In painting from such antique models, he says in his De Imitatione Statuarum, a treatise 'on the imitation of sculpture', the statuary has to be humanised, translated into flesh and blood.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Mythological'],['Flemish'],['Baroque'],a painting of three women sitting on a rock,"RUBENS, Peter Paul","Venus, Cupid, Baccchus and Ceres",Images\35473-11mythol.jpg,"(33, 26, 23)","(223, 202, 190)","(108, 78, 75)",,0.3292281659388646,0.2380884279475982,0.2784126637554585,0.1542707423580786,"(33, 26, 23)","(108, 78, 75)","(223, 202, 190)",

19902-01henry8.jpg,"Henry VIII (1491-1547), king of England (1509-47), who presided over the beginnings of the English Renaissance and the English Reformation. His six wives were, successively, Catherine of Aragon (the mother of the future queen Mary I), Anne Boleyn (the mother of the future queen Elizabeth I), Jane Seymour (the mother of Henry's successor, Edward VI), Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr.This portrait is the only surviving individual portrait of Henry that Holbein himself painted. In terms of features, it corresponds largely to the figure in the Whitehall cartoon. Both portraits are likely to have been based on a single, now lost portrait study by Holbein. However, as a consequence of the small format of the panel painting, the heavy shoulder chain that the king wears in the monumental portrait is omitted here, and his sleeves are embroidered with a very delicate gold thread.This is the quintessential image of the overbearing and tyrannous monarch, from the year the dissolution of the monasteries (and the consequent appropriation of their wealth for the Crown and its servants) was instigated. Holbein depicts the King at `face value', without flattery, emphasizing the small, humourless eyes and mouth, the curiously flat cheeks and chin. Henry's bulky and capricious authority haunts the work despite its small size. Its condensation of magnificence run riot here takes the form of real gold used in the chain, jewellery and collar.The portrait is undoubtedly a tour de force; after its execution, Holbein's position at the court seems to have been secure, and he was used as a painter-ambassador when the King's marital plans unraveled in the late 1530s. Only his misleading portrayal of Anne of Cleves would check his popularity.The subsequent spawning of similar but less effective portraits of the king by Holbein's followers has tended to obscure the compelling mixture of simplicity and realism displayed in this design - the tilt and curve of the black and white hat, the fearful symmetry of the jewelled jacket and the modelling of the hands: imitators often managed either simplicity or realism but never both.","['Oil', 'wood']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['German'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a man in a white hat and gold necklace,"HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger",Portrait of Henry VIII,Images\19902-01henry8.jpg,"(91, 75, 74)",,"(51, 35, 22)","(181, 139, 101)",0.3245874292523086,0.142645218945487,0.2957271373249925,0.2370402144772118,"(91, 75, 74)","(51, 35, 22)","(181, 139, 101)",

Probably at no other point in his life did Friedrich enjoy more profound appreciation and greater admiration than in the years around 1810. Two landscapes in particular were responsible for thrusting Friedrich into the limelight. In 1810 they were exhibited as pendants at the Academy exhibition in Berlin, where they were purchased by the Prussian king Frederick William III. These two paintings were The Monk by the Sea and the Abbey in the Oakwood.The Abbey in the Oakwood is an expression of grief at the loss of a great past. The artist has chosen to depict an architectural ruin; it may testify to the sublimity of the past, but it is a monument in a graveyard.The Napoleonic invasion of Germany and the consequent War of Liberation had added a patriotic dimension to Friedrich's subjects of north German ecclesiastical buildings in ruins or, in imagination, raised again. While the essential message of the Abbey in the Oak-wood of 1810 is the passing of the earthly life, its fog-bound ruin and blasted, leafless trees inevitably evoked the contemporary state of Germany.The painting was exhibited with its companion picture, the Monk by the Sea.

One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'. It has also been suggested that Goya intended this painting as a pendant to Time and the Old Women. The two canvases are almost exactly the same size, were acquired for the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille, at the same time and have the same provenance. But there seems to be no obvious connection between the subjects of the two paintings and Time and the Old Women, which is known to have been in Goya's possession in 1812, is almost certainly a slightly earlier work. There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings. But the composition is less contrived and, as in many other works, chiefly the uncommissioned ones, it appears to be based on a scene that the artist had witnessed and recorded on the spot or from memory.

As a letter written to an English artist he had met in Antwerp reveals, he continued with what he had been doing in Antwerp. He enrolled again in an atelier, where he could draw and paint the nude from plaster casts and live models.Since he could ill afford to hire models, he painted large numbers of still-lifes of flowers in order to study the colour theory of Hals and Delacroix. He wrote that he was 'trying to render intense colour and not a grey harmony'. The present painting indicates to what extent he had accomplished this aim. It also demonstrates the now varied ways in which he applied his paint: dashes in the background to break up the blue field of the wall, directional brushstrokes on the table, impasto highlights on the metal vase.

07586-53mercy0.jpg,"From the fiefs of the Colonna family Caravaggio took refuge in Naples, in 1606. There he began to work again with his usual, astounding speed. Early in January 1607 he was paid for the immense altarpiece commissioned to him by the Pio Monte di Misericordia (where it may still be seen today). The painting shows the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is very complicated in its organization. Caravaggio actually had to add a series of figures (two angels and the Madonna and Child, the latter painted later) in the upper part of the painting, which make the composition of the picture the most complex, perhaps, in any of his works. Caravaggio did not paint exemplary episodes intended to stir the viewer to religious piety through the illustrative emphasis of gestures and feelings. Rather, he entrusted the educational effectiveness of his works to the evidence of things in themselves, in the conviction that nothing should be added above and beyond what is already contained in the intrinsic eloquence of the various poses.The seven acts of mercy represented on the painting are the following. On the right appear the (1) burial of the dead and the episode of the so-called Carita Romana (Cimon's daughter giving her father suck in prison), which contains at once the two charitable acts of (2) visiting prisoners and (3) feeding the hungry. (4) Dressing the naked appears in the foreground, symbolized by St. Martin and the beggar. Next to this scene, the host and St. James of Compostela allude to the (5) offering of hospitality to pilgrims. (6) Relieving the thirsty is represented by Samson drinking from the ox jaw. The youth on the ground behind the beggar of St. Martin may also represent the merciful gesture of (7) caring for the sick.We readily apprehend the artist's power of synthesis, which concentrates a conceptual content that is potentially quite dispersive, in the model behavior of a few figures.

It may be a measure of the Catholic Church's confidence in winning the battle for souls that it could increasingly tolerate such overtly erotic decoration, even in a cardinal's palace, albeit in what was probably one of the more private rooms.

Whereas in his earlier engraved work Bruegel represented the Vices as elaborate allegories peopled by Boschian monsters, here human weakness is commented on in an understated, naturalistic and humorous manner.The wedding feast is dominated by the figure of the bride who, radiant and composed, presides over the table beneath a canopy. Less obvious is the identity of the bridegroom; he may be the man in black, with his back to the spectator, leaning back on his stool, mug in hand, calling for more wine. The feast is taking place in the barn, the wall behind the guests consisting of stacked-up straw or corn. Two ears of corn with a rake call to the mind work that harvesting involves. The plates are being carried around on a door taken off its hinges. The principal form of nourishment in those day consisted of bread, porridge and soup.A curious detail of the scene which has never been satisfactorily explained is the presence on the far right of a richly-dressed nobleman in earnest conversation with a monk.

24776-annuncia.jpg,"""Based on its style the Annunciation is attributed to the Master of Flémalle and dated between c. 1415 and 1425. The painter's provisional name refers to the """"Abbey of Flémalle"""" where certain of his works are assumed to have been painted. However, in this village near Liège there was never any abbey. Today the master is commonly identified with the Tournai artist Robert Campin.The scene takes place inside a bourgeois dwelling, a novelty in the painting of the time, as until then the scene had always been depicted in or in front of a church. In line with tradition, Gabriel enters the room from the left. The Virgin is seated in front of a low bench on the tiled floor, a sign of her humility. The edge of her mantle is decorated with an inscription, another innovation of the Master of Flémalle. Its text appears to be inspired by the popular medieval Marian hymn Salve Regina. The Virgin's gestures illustrate her acceptance. Her right hand rests on her breast, her eyes modestly cast downwards. On Mary's lap is an open book, a second one lies on the table. This motif is possibly taken from devotional tracts of around 1400, which state that the Virgin was meditating on the Holy Scriptures when Gabriel entered. The books also indicate her as the possessor of divine wisdom. In this connection, the bench is decorated with little lions, as was once the throne of Solomon, the Old Testament king who used to be seen as the epitome of wisdom. The stained glass figures possibly represent prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.Other apparently everyday objects also have an additional, deeper significance. The hand broom next to the chimney symbolises the purification from the stain of sin, and the white lilies in the maiolica vase Mary's virginity. The open window probably alludes to her honorary title as 'fenestra coeli', the window of heaven. The candles and their holders refer to Christ and the Virgin. The fact that the candles are snuffed out indicates that conception has already taken place. One intriguing detail is the woodcut above the chimney, depicting St Christopher carrying the Child across the river.

Construction of the building and the decoration of the interiors extended over a long period of time, brought to completion only in 1570.The fresco decoration of the loggia, the Central Hall, and two other rooms (Room of Scipio and Room of Sofonisba) was completed by Giovanni Antonio Fasolo and Giovanni Battista Zelotti by 1570.

25926-cremona1.jpg,"The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the façade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the façade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515. Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative. The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.Melone continued the cycle on the right wall, he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists",['Fresco'],['Unknown'],['Religious'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],"the triumph of the person, person, person, person, person, person, person, person,","MELONE, Altobello",Flight to Egypt,Images\25926-cremona1.jpg,"(47, 34, 34)","(154, 133, 118)",,"(104, 80, 69)",0.2900307692307692,0.2478072398190045,0.1345266968325791,0.3276352941176471,"(104, 80, 69)","(47, 34, 34)","(154, 133, 118)",
05197-09folly.jpg,"""In the midst of a luxuriant summer landscape, a surgeon removes an object from the head of a man tied to a chair; a monk and a nun look on. This little picture may not be entirely by Bosch; the awkward and inexpressive figures are perhaps by an inferior hand, but only Bosch could have been responsible for the landscape background whose delicately painted forms recall the vista in his early Epiphany. The open-air operation, its circular shape suggesting a mirror, is set within a framework of elaborate calligraphical decoration containing the inscription: """"Master, cut the stone out, my name is Lubbert Das.""""In Bosch's day, the stone operation was a piece of quackery in which the patient was supposedly cured of his stupidity through the removal of the stone of folly from his forehead. Fortunately, it was performed only in fiction, not in fact, for in literary examples of this theme it generally left the patient worse off than before. The name """"Lubbert"""", on the other hand, frequently appears in Dutch literature to designate persons exhibiting an unusually high degree of human stupidity. The stone operation was occasionally represented by later Netherlandish artists, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder. This subject undoubtedly inspired Bosch's picture, but no extant version of it accounts for the funnel and the book perched on the heads of two of the characters, nor does it explain the presence of the monk and the nun, although their apparent acquiescence in the quackery certainly places them in an unfavourable light. It will be noted, too, that what the surgeon extracts from Lubbert's head is not a stone, but a flower; another flower of the same species lies on the table at the right. The flowers has identified as tulips and their presence is explained as a play on the Dutch word for tulip which in the sixteenth century also carried the connotation of stupidity and folly.""","['Oil', 'panel']",['Horizontal'],['Genre'],['Netherlandish'],['Renaissance'],"the cover of the book, the witches and the witches","BOSCH, Hieronymus",The Cure of Folly (Extraction of the Stone of Madness),Images\05197-09folly.jpg,"(95, 70, 43)","(20, 15, 13)",,,0.2897492193598751,0.4787773224043716,0.0824756049960968,0.1489978532396565,"(20, 15, 13)","(95, 70, 43)",,
30863-keys.jpg,"The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Likely in charge of the entire project of the fresco decoration on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, Pietro Perugino retained for himself not only representations on the altar wall (which eventually were replaced by Michelangelo's Last Judgment) but also other significant scenes, such as Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, a most fitting subject for Pope Sixtus' chapel. The fresco is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the gold and silver keys to the kneeling St Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open piazza is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles, although they are not used in defining the spatial organization. Nor is the relationship between the figures and the felicitous invention of the porticoed Temple of Salomon that dominates the picture effectively resolved. The triumphal arches at the extremities appear as superfluous antiquarian references, suitable for a Roman audience. Scattered in the middle distance are two secondary scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right.The style of the figures is dependent upon Verrocchio. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to  minor detail.The octagonal temple with its ample porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael",['Fresco'],['Vertical'],['Religious'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],the last supper painting the last supper by person,"PERUGINO, Pietro",Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter,Images\30863-keys.jpg,"(51, 41, 39)",,"(100, 88, 88)","(153, 141, 141)",0.2895053849222178,0.1949966759739396,0.3018228958915038,0.2136750432123388,"(100, 88, 88)","(51, 41, 39)","(153, 141, 141)",

It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule.

However, the handling in the sky and the foliage is more reminiscent of the work of Monet from this period. The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting.

39592-2pesaro0.jpg,"Titian was neither such a universal scholar as Leonardo, nor such an outstanding personality as Michelangelo, nor such a versatile and attractive man as Raphael. He was principally a painter, but a painter whose handling of paint equalled Michelangelo's mastery of draughtsmanship. This supreme skill enabled him to disregard all the time-honoured rules of composition, and to rely on colour to restore the unity which he apparently broke up.We need but look at Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family which was begun only some fifteen years after Giovanni Bellini's Madonna with saints to realize the effect which his art must have had on contemporaries. It was almost unheard of to move the Holy Virgin out of the centre of the picture, and to place the two administering saints - St Francis, who is recognizable by the Stigmata (the wounds of the Cross), and St Peter, who has deposited the key (emblem of his dignity) on the steps of the Virgin's throne - not symmetrically on each side, as Giovanni Bellini had done, but as active participants of a scene.In this altar-painting, Titian had to revive the tradition of donors' portraits, but did it in an entirely novel way. The picture was intended as a token of thanksgiving for a victory over the Turks by the Venetian nobleman Jacopo Pesaro, and Titian portrayed him kneeling before the Virgin while an armoured standard-bearer drags a Turkish prisoner behind him. St Peter and the Virgin look down on him benignly while St Francis, on the other side, draws the attention of the Christ Child to the other members of the Pesaro family, who are kneeling in the corner of the picture. The whole scene seems to take place in an open courtyard, with two giant columns which rise into the clouds where two little angels are playfully engaged in raising the Cross.Titian's contemporaries may well have been amazed at the audacity with which he had dared to upset the old-established rules of composition. They must have expected, at first, to find such a picture lopsided and unbalanced. Actually it is the opposite. The unexpected composition only serves to make it gay and lively without upsetting the harmony of it all. The main reason is the way in which Titian contrived to let light, air and colours unify the scene.

The basket ran aground and the twins were discovered by a female wolf. The wolf nursed the babies for a short time before they were found by a shepherd. The shepherd then brought up the twins.When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them.

35717-ruined_c.jpg,"Panoramic views of the flat plains in Holland are often said to be the most distinctive contribution of Dutch landscape painting. They differ from the 'world panorama' of earlier Flemish art by seemingly recording the momentary view of a single scene, rather than being composed of a collection of separate visual memories. Formally, they are characterized bb a low horizon line, implying a low viewpoint. Although Ruisdael, perhaps the greatest and the most versatile Dutch landscape specialist, did not invent this type of picture, he became one of its most distinguished practitioners.This painting may represent a view in Gooiland, a district to the east of Amsterdam; there are, however, at least four other, smaller landscapes by Ruisdael that show the same view or part of it with considerable variations, and it is clear that he was not attempting strict topographical accuracy. Despite the pretence of spontaneity, this work, like all landscape paintings of the time, is a synthetic product of the artist's studio.Its dominant feature is the sky, to which two thirds of the picture surface is devoted and which is also reflected in the water of the foreground. This is the real, moisture-laden sky of Holland billowing with clouds, the sun breaking sporadically through scattering shafts of light across the countryside - effects which Constable was later to emulate. Almost more remarkable than the truthful record of the shape, density and illumination of the clouds is the illusion that they are moving through space and over our heads (we tend to think that perspective does not govern cloudscapes, but these seem to taper towards the horizon and broaden at the upper edge of the painting). The long horizon too seems to extend beyond the frame, broken only by church spires and the tiny white sails of a windmill. But our sense of inhabiting the landscape is compromised by our viewpoint in relation to the foreground. By letting us look down into the bastion standing below the horizon line, the painter suggests that we are viewing it from some improbably high place, higher also than the shore on which the peasants graze their flock (both figures and animals were painted by Adriaen van der Velde, a division of labour quite common in Dutch landscapes).

44680-tribuna.jpg,"The painting has become one of the most celebrated images of eighteenth-century taste. Zoffany shows a group of connoisseurs and members of the nobility admiring works of art in the Tribuna, the principal room of the Uffizi in Florence, which was the most famous gallery in the world during the eighteenth century. The Tribuna had been built by Francesco de' Medici in 1585-9 to a design by Bernardo Buontalenti as a showcase for the most precious items in the Medici collection. Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale. In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture. The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor. The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772. Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray. Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael. For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion. The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici. These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene. In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force. The attention to detail and texture involves not just the portraits, but also the copies after the works of art nearly all of which are identifiable. Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Interior'],['German'],"['Rococo', 'Neoclassicism']",a painting of a room with many people,"ZOFFANY, Johann",The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Images\44680-tribuna.jpg,"(170, 123, 93)","(39, 32, 31)",,"(110, 76, 59)",0.2727174269773548,0.2664680013127666,0.168206760748277,0.2926078109616016,"(110, 76, 59)","(170, 123, 93)","(39, 32, 31)",

07663-carlev08.jpg,"The painting affords a view of the Serenissima's most characteristic quay: the Molo, with the columns of San Marco and San Todaro (or Teodoro) framing the entrance to the city. On the left stands the Ducal Palace, rendered in minute detail. The steep perspective in which the building is captured continues into the background along the Riva degli Schiavoni. Cast in contrasting light and truncated by the upper border of the image, the column of San Todaro dominates the scene. Between it and the column of San Marco the mast of a schooner appears in the background; it marks the central axis of the composition. Together with the large schooner on the right, the column of San Todaro to some extent counterbalances the buildings which occupy the left side. There is much activity both on the water and in the Square, where most of the figures are gathered in small groups.This view of the Molo and the Ducal Palace towards the east is highly unusual. Instead of depicting the Palace frontally, Carlevaris turned a quarter circle so that we look down the façade of the building towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a composition he also used in four later works. The vantage-point in all these works is from the loggia of the Library, directly opposite the Ducal Palace.Although the architecture dominates the composition, the artist paid close attention to the human figures. Drawn or painted studies for several of the macchiette have survived. Scenes of people and situations drawn from everyday life were introduced to Italy in the first half of the seventeenth century by Dutch painters active in Rome. In the course of the century the so-called Bamboccianti cast such everyday scenes with growing frequency against a &#151; sometimes identifiable &#151; urban background. One of these painters was Johannes Lingelbach, whose work seems to have inspired Carlevaris's vedute. The Venetian artist is thought to have spent some time in Rome, where he could have become familiar with Lingelbach's work.Carlevaris's town views are also deeply rooted in the Venetian tradition of depicting historic or festive events. His View of the Molo with the Ducal Palace, however, does not document a procession, reception or other festivity; rather, it subordinates the human figures to a portrayal of one part of the city in meticulous, topographically correct detail from an unorthodox point of view","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],['Rococo'],a painting of a city with people and buildings,"CARLEVARIS, Luca",The Molo with the Ducal Palace,Images\07663-carlev08.jpg,"(50, 43, 31)","(152, 149, 131)","(203, 203, 193)","(106, 95, 70)",0.2676103699882075,0.270285168533805,0.2350797833136792,0.2270246781643081,"(152, 149, 131)","(50, 43, 31)","(203, 203, 193)","(106, 95, 70)"

A model drawing may have existed in David's studio or perhaps there was another prototype by his hand which is now lost. On closer examination David seems here to have built on both Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling.The composition of the scene is a kind of reprise of Memling's Reins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges). Here too, the scene is set in front of a landscape with on the left buildings intended to represent Jerusalem and on the right a group of rocks which serves as a repoussoir. The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which he placed at Christ's disposal, has been hewn out of the rocks here. Wearing a turban and exotic clothing he stands in profile before the tombstone, while Nicodemus enters the tomb. With Memling it is a Roman sarcophagus which stands in front of the rock and which is being opened by Joseph and Nicodemus. The composition itself, with the body held almost upright under the armpits and the head nodding to one side, derives from the right wing of Hugo van der Goes' Lamentation diptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The figure of the Virgin placed parallel along Christ's body with her arm diagonally across it is an adaptation in reverse of the Virgin's posture in Van der Goes. The same is probably also the case with the position of the squatting Mary Magdalene. The St John, with his right knee and foot in frontal view, is also borrowed from Memling's Reins triptych.

What is certain is that after a comprehensible, temporary attribution to Verrocchio or his shop, art critics subsequently almost universally assigned the painting to Leonardo, a jjudgment backed up by the most recent research. In fact, the richness of the drapery, the vastness of the mountain scenery with purple and gold hues tingeing the foothills of peaks that fade into the sky, the vitality of the cut flowers in the crystal vase and the softness of the Child's flesh that foreshadows the tender putti of the Virgin of the Rocks, are elements that show a distancing from the more distinctive Verrocchiesque style and instead assume those formal and chromatic characteristics that would be the mature Leonardo's very own.

12114-du_barry.jpg,"""Jeanne Bécu, comtesse du Barry (1743-1793), was the mistress of Louis XV. She was the natural daughter of a poor woman of Vaucouleurs. Placed in a convent in Paris at an early age, she received a very slight education, learning little but the catechism and drawing; and at the age of sixteen entered a milliner's shop in the rue St Honoré. Subsequently she lived as a courtesan under the name of Mlle Lange. Her great personal charms led the adventurer Jean, comte du Barry, to take her into his house in order to make it more attractive to the dupes whose money he won by gambling. Her success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a higher flight, and through Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV, and the duc de Richelieu, he succeeded in installing her as mistress of the king. In order to present her at court it was necessary to find a title for her, and as Count Jean du Barry was married, his brother Guillaume offered himself as nominal husband. The comtesse du Barry was presented at court on the 22nd of April 1769, and became official mistress of the king.Her influence over the monarch was absolute until his death in 1774 when an order of his successor banished her to the abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, but, the queen interceding for her, the king in the following year gave her permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Here she led a retired life with the comte de Cosse-Brissac, and was visited there by Benjamin Franklin and the emperor Joseph II, among many other distinguished men.Having gone to England in 1792 to endeavour to raise money on her jewels, she was on her return accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal of having dissipated the treasures of the state, conspired against the republic, and worn, in London, """"mourning for the tyrant."""" She was condemned to death by guillotine on the 8th of December 1793, and beheaded the same evening.By the time the comtesse du Barry had arrived at Versailles, Drouais had completed posthumously the last portrait of Madame de Pompadour, a sumptuous affair that surely qualifies as his masterpiece. It was fitting that the new royal paramour would choose as her official portraitist an artist who could immortalize her predecessor with such refinement and elegance. She commissioned him to paint for both the ch&#226;teau and the pavilion of Luciennes a series of delightful pictures. During the comtesse du Barry's years at court, Drouais created five distinct portraits of her, as well as additional copies of the five images""","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['French'],['Rococo'],a painting of a woman with flowers in her hair,"DROUAIS, François-Hubert","Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry",Images\12114-du_barry.jpg,"(191, 189, 191)","(23, 23, 21)",,,0.2472086431226765,0.5067960037174721,0.134096189591078,0.1118991635687732,"(23, 23, 21)","(191, 189, 191)",,

Potter can paint equally well the bright sunlight and the cool air, but his real fame lies with his penetrating portraits of animals. His best-known work is the life-size Young Bull, an unusual heroization of a single animal, a counterpart to the monumental trend of Ruisdael and Cuyp.Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages. The ancient Greek painter Zeuxis used a similar method; when he painted his portrait of Helen in the city of Croton he chose five beautiful virgins, in order to copy the finest features of each, for in one woman he felt he could not find perfect beauty.What makes this painting so special is the fact that Potter painted something as ordinary as a bull on such a grand scale - which had never been done before. And despite this large size, he paid great attention to the smallest details.During the nineteenth century the Young Bull by the twenty-two-year-old Potter ranked close in fame to the Night Watch of Rembrandt. Later generations have been less captivated by Potter's fidelity to nature when he worked life-size. Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless. Atmosphere enters the picture only in the lovely distant view on the right, where a sunny light plays upon the cattle in the meadows and on the woods, making this passage one of his loveliest landscapes.

It is not certain that the predella and the crowning element originally formed part of the same altarpiece; and the accuracy of the entire reconstruction is in doubt. The panels are the following:Central panel: Madonna and Child (165 x 80 cm); side panels: Sts Jerome, Alexander, Vincent, Anthony (137 x 39 cm each); upper side panels: Sts Clare, Bonaventura, Louis, Bernardino (126 x 40 cm each); upper centralaa panel: St Francis (128 x 82 cm); predella panels showing scenes from the Life of Christ (87 x 30 cm each) and two Angels in Adoration (27 x 29 cm each).This altarpiece belongs to Foppa's early stylistic maturity and retains the archaising tendency toward simplification of his youthful period, before he was influenced by Leonardo and Bramante. It also shows the pungent impetuosity of Mantegna's influence in the sharply drawn perspective, and in the tension and almost metallic consistency of the forms. In this resplendent altarpiece, the central panels are particularly fine examples of Foppa's masterly interweaving of colour and light. The Madonna's face, lightly thrown into relief, concludes a series of circling motifs enhanced by the elegant twist of the body of the Child, as he leans over to pluck the string of the lute.

Van Gogh's unique facility for communicating his feelings directly by means of his brushwork is already in evidence. The light and the associated atmospheric effects have become the actual subject of the picture, very much in the spirit of the Impressionists. Although still restrained, the painting is defined in terms of colour by contrasting complementary colours: blue and orange, red and green.By the middle of 1887 a dramatic change of style has occurred in van Gogh's work. Using these characteristically 'impressionist' motifs of a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, van Gogh seems to have been willing to experiment with Impressionist techniques as well. However, the painting lacks a sense of substance and conviction, which reflects his difficulty in feeling himself as part of the world he is portraying.In the two years van Gogh spent in Paris he tried to assimilate French Impressionism, only to find that a new generation of painters were questioning its premises regarding both subject-matter and style.

The subject, shown seated in her bath, traditionally was believed to be the famous beauty, Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566), a favourite of Henry II and virtual ruler of France. However, this identification is now rejected, and the dating, placed either in the 1550s or around 1571 is debated. Diane do Poitiers. Other candidates for the identity of the sitter are Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) and Marie Touchet, mistress to Charles IX.This is the classic portrayal of a Royal mistress in her official role, cool, beautiful, aloof, bejewelled even in her bath, accompanied by the strappings of her state: fine rooms, a noble child in the arms of its leering, accomplice-nurse, the sly Love-child stealing the fruits, the flower of passion in her hand.Regarding the several influences, Titian's influence has been cited. The motif of the servant in the background performing a domestic chore is seen as deriving from the Venus of Urbino.

44721-farnese1.jpg,"The art-historical importance of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, near Viterbo, is the famous pentagonal ground plan and round interior courtyard, and the interior frescoes. The Palazzo was built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) who was made cardinal by his grandfather Pope Paul III (1468-1549), and named vice chancellor of the Holy Roman Church a year later, according him the highest position after that of the pope in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.The architect of the construction, Giacomo da Vignola, found that the form of the ground plan and the site of the building were dictated by an incomplete fortress begun in the 1530s by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger - a project that had not gone further than the exterior walls on the ground floor. Vignola approached the unfinished structure as a challenge and opportunity to create a unique solution. What was built from 1559 onward had the form of a fortress and the function of a villa, but was in its extravagance an urban palace.The commission for the interior decoration went to Taddeo Zuccaro, who was to make drawings and cartoons for the painting and stucco work but he had to work there only to review from time to time the work that had been carried out there. He largely assigned the execution to others, in particular his brother Federico. After the death of Taddeo Zuccaro in 1566, his younger brother Federico continued the work until 1569. His successor was Jacopo Bertoia, then Giovanni de' Vecchi, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio.The principle according to which the walls and ceilings were painted was retained for all apartments: only in public rooms (halls and their antechambers) were frescoes painted on ceilings and walls, while painting in the private rooms was limited to the vaults, with walls covered in silk, brocade, and similar materials. The themes painted in the ground floor apartments, intended for various uses by guests, are all taken from classical mythology.  The themes of the apartments situated above these on the piano nobile focus decidedly on the master of the house and the function of the individual rooms.In the two rooms on the piano nobile suited for a larger public, the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani and the Sala del Concilio, Taddeo Zuccaro painted a cycle depicting, in a total of twenty-three scenes, the history of the Farnese family",['Fresco'],['Unknown'],['Historical'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],the ceiling is painted with murals,"ZUCCARO, Taddeo",General view of the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani,Images\44721-farnese1.jpg,"(71, 46, 31)",,"(191, 155, 127)","(136, 99, 73)",0.238255263308039,0.1903862611970103,0.2848838934215781,0.2864745820733725,"(136, 99, 73)","(191, 155, 127)","(71, 46, 31)",

11273-207delac.jpg,"Delacroix's grandest pictures have never left their country of origin. Only in Paris can we fully appreciate the bold reconciliation of beauty with cruelty, sensuality with control, fantasy with observation, modernity with tradition that characterises the art of this influential painter.'As Byron signifies Romantic poetry, so Romantic French art means above all Delacroix. Like Byron he achieved his flamboyant artistic effects through intense intellectual application and a firm grasp of technique. Pupil of an academic artist, he was essentially self-taught through the study of the great Renaissance and seventeenth-century colourists in the Louvre. He was fascinated by the vibrant brushwork of the Venetians and their Flemish heir Rubens, imitating their capacity to simulate brilliant daylight even in the shadows, their use of colour instead of line as the primary structural element. It was precisely these effects which, as employed by Constable in the Hay-Wain exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1824, caused a sensation and further exacerbated Delacroix's fashionable Anglomania. In 1825, having sold his picture of the Massacre of Chios to the French State, he set out for London with two English friends, the watercolourists Richard Bonington and Thales Fielding. They visited galleries and the theatre and read English poets. Delacroix met other English artists, including Thomas Lawrence. Appropriately for a painting in an English collection, the lifesize likeness of Louis-Auguste Schwiter, painted after Delacroix's return to Paris, is an essay in the portrait style of Lawrence.Schwiter, a lifelong friend of Delacroix, was himself a painter. He is presented here, however, as a gentleman, dressed in elegant black and hat in hand, standing on what appears to be the terrace of a great country house, as if waiting to be admitted. The blue Chinese vase with its heavily paint-textured flowers contrasts with the red lining of his hat. Like the trumpet vine clippings on the paving, these touches of colour serve to relate the foreground to the brooding sunset landscape (said to have been painted in part by Paul Huet, another artist friend), thus counteracting the isolation of Schwiter's monochrome silhouette.The portrait is lit from the right, a reversal of the more usual illumination from the left, highlighting the left side of the sitter's face and perhaps helping to account for the curiously tentative impression he gives, despite his firm stance in the centre of the picture and his direct gaze. The unemphatic 'modern' pose, with its hint of English-style reserve, and the free 'unfinished' brushwork made this full-length portrait, at once so formal and so unconventional, unacceptable to the judges of the 1827 Paris Salon exhibition, and it was rejected. Delacroix later reworked the painting, finally completing it in 1830","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['French'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a man in a black suit and white shirt,"DELACROIX, Eug?ne",Louis-Auguste Schwiter,Images\11273-207delac.jpg,"(74, 61, 46)",,"(17, 14, 11)","(117, 104, 85)",0.2304381956649092,0.1116274165202109,0.4529654364381956,0.2049689513766842,"(17, 14, 11)","(74, 61, 46)","(117, 104, 85)",

15943-venus.jpg,"Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter. The Sleeping Venus is a case in point. The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting. She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature. Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies. Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed. Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world. Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master. In the Sleeping Venus a significant share has been assumed for Titian, especially in the landscape, where on the right a cupid has been painted out. The outstretched figure, stocky in proportions, is usually considered to be by Giorgione. The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface. But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality. Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject. There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed. If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Mythological'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a woman laying on a blanket,GIORGIONE,Sleeping Venus,Images\15943-venus.jpg,"(229, 193, 134)","(99, 55, 37)","(180, 138, 86)","(39, 19, 17)",0.2300868306801736,0.2551306716608496,0.2226713203371073,0.2921111773218694,"(39, 19, 17)","(99, 55, 37)","(229, 193, 134)","(180, 138, 86)"

As certain critics have pointed out, the Quarate predella shows the same interest in narrative, lively colours and description of details which is typical of Uccello's production in the years when he was working on the Prato frescoes (1435-40). A feeling of abstraction pervades these scenes, today no more than a group of fragments of faded and almost undecipherable images, in which we can make out a few architectural structures shown in accurate perspective and some monks laid out according to geometric patterns. In the extravagant choice of colours Uccello appears to have given his fantasy free rein; in fact, as Vasari noted, """"he did not pay much attention to the rule of consistency in colour, as was usual in the painting of stories; for he made the fields blue, the cities red, and the buildings the colour he felt like.""",['Panel'],['Vertical'],['Religious'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a woman sitting on a couch,"UCCELLO, Paolo",St John on Patmos (Quarate predella),Images\40383-2quarat1.jpg,"(70, 51, 44)","(202, 101, 64)",,"(130, 87, 73)",0.2220982369585721,0.2378190524559239,0.1509366611042588,0.389146049481245,"(130, 87, 73)","(202, 101, 64)","(70, 51, 44)",

The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. Form is more in evidence here than in the Assumption, especially in the Michelangelesque motif of the naked Christ (for which the artist probably drew inspiration from Michelangelo's  Piet&#224; for Vittoria Colonna), and it is only later that he treats his figures with the same freedom as draperies.

Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po).

26143-37frag1.jpg,"A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date.

15483-0chapel.jpg,"""""""... He did a chapel in Santissima Trinita for Francesco Sassetti with stories of St Francis, an admirable work, remarkable for its grace, finish and delicacy"""" (Vasari).Francesco Sassetti had gained his wealth as a partner in the French branches of the Medici bank in Avignon and Lyon. He also spent over ten years representing the Medici bank in Genoa and occasionally in Geneva. But he was not always successful later on in his role as the chairman of the bank, and in 1484 was replaced by Giovanni Tornabuoni. By the end of the 1470s, Sassetti had already acquired the rights of patronage to a small side chapel, the second to the right of the choir in the Florentine church of Santissima Trinita. It was probable at this time that Ghirlandaio was commissioned to paint the chapel, which he decorated with frescoes between 1482 and 1485.The donor and his wife had themselves portrayed as life-sized figures kneeling in prayer at the side of the altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds. The donors are adoring the Christ Child, just like the shepherds in the panel painting. An incomplete inscription under their portraits names the day on which the chapel was consecrated, 25 December 1485, hence also the date by which it would have been completed. This year corresponds with the complete inscription on the altarpiece. In the Sassetti Chapel the artist combined secular, religious, and classical themes to produce a unique masterpiece.In the scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of contemporaries and views of Florence: he recreated religious events to the Florence of his day. In contrast to the newly built Saint Fina Chapel, the Sassetti Chapel was old and in the Gothic style. On each of its three walls Ghirlandaio painted two scenes from the life of Saint Francis, completed by a seventh fresco in the tympanum over the arched entrance to the chapel. At the crown of the entrance arch, the Sassetti coat of arms is surrounded by a garland of fruit, a sculptural work made of terracotta. The fresco in the tympanum above shows a sibyl prophesying Christ's dominion over the world to Emperor Augustus. The fresco idealizes the classical period as the precursor to the Christian age, and this provides a link with the chapel's high point, the altarpiece, which depicts the birth of Christ. The grisaille figure of David outside the chapel can also be interpreted in this way.On the two side walls of the chapel are the black marble sarcophagi of Francesco Sassetti and his wife Nera Corsi, set into niches with round arches. Here the sculptural decorations are dominated by classical motifs; the sculptor Giuliano da Sangallo is sometimes identified as the artist. The tomb niches are framed by grisaille frescoes, in which Ghirlandaio cites motifs from classical coins. Above each are two monumental frescoes by Ghirlandaio, which clearly owe a debt to traditional images. There are still echoes of the pictorial order established by Giotto in Assisi over 160 years earlier. Ghirlandaio studied Giotto's frescoes in the Bardi Chapel, dating from about 1325, in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence, and made direct use of them""",['Fresco'],['Unknown'],['Interior'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a church with a large altar,"GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico",View of the Sassetti Chapel,Images\15483-0chapel.jpg,"(174, 142, 110)","(51, 37, 29)",,"(113, 85, 66)",0.2173236448498992,0.3490378699480216,0.1658565821576323,0.2677819030444468,"(51, 37, 29)","(113, 85, 66)","(174, 142, 110)",

39719-2venus_a.jpg,"""Between 1553 and 1554 Titian executed for the Habsburgs two classical mythological works of clearly erotic intent which he himself described as """"poesie"""" (mythological fables). These are the Dana&#235; with a Nurse and the Venus and Adonis, both now in the Prado, Madrid. The Venus and Adonis became the prototype for a whole series of replicas of this subject.Venus, the goddess of love, falls in love with Adonis, a beautiful youth. Her love is not, however, enough to stop him pursuing his favourite pastime, hunting, which will lead to his undoing, for he is gored to death by a boar. There is an interesting letter from Titian to Philip II which deals with this painting. The artist makes a special point of mentioning that he was particularly interested in depicting the body from both sides.In both paintings the scene of the union of the lovers is bathed in the warm light of sunset, where the diffuse softness of the colours holds sway. The female nudes reveal the continuing inspiration of Michelangelo's sculpture, such as the Dawn and Night from the Medici tombs in Florence. But what is entirely personal to Titian is the quality of the colour, which fragments into patches of dazzling luminosity - a perfect complement to the ecstatic sensuous abandon of the figures.In its own day Venus and Adonis was considered one of Titian's most erotic works, especially in the compression of Venus' buttocks in her seated pose, but it also suggests the indulgent condescension of a younger man towards the frantic and overprotective reaction of an older woman""","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Mythological'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a man with a dog,TIZIANO Vecellio,Venus and Adonis,Images\39719-2venus_a.jpg,"(77, 52, 42)",,"(127, 97, 78)","(27, 14, 13)",0.2152894165114835,0.0835824022346368,0.2121663563004345,0.4889618249534451,"(27, 14, 13)","(77, 52, 42)","(127, 97, 78)",

Since the artist turned 27 on the 21 May, the picture must date from the beginning of the year. The artist's pose is self confident, showing him standing upright and turning slightly to lean his right arm on a ledge. Dürer's figure fills the picture, with his hat almost touching the top. His face and neck glow from the light streaming into the room and his long curly hair is painstakingly depicted. Unlike his earlier self portrait, he now has a proper beard, which was then unusual among young men. Nine years later Dürer wrote an ironic poem in which he described himself as `the painter with the hairy beard'.The artist's clothing is flamboyant. His elegant jacket is edged with black and beneath this he wears a white, pleated shirt, embroidered along the neckline. His jaunty hat is striped, to match the jacket. Over his left shoulder hangs a light-brown cloak, tied around his neck with a twisted cord. He wears fine kid gloves.Inside the room is a tall archway, partly framing Dürer's head, and to the right a window opens out onto an exquisite landscape. Green fields give way to a tree-ringed lake and beyond are snow-capped mountains, probably a reminder of Dürer's journey over the Alps three years earlier. Depicting a distant landscape, viewed through a window, was a device borrowed from Netherlandish portraiture.The Germans still tended to consider the artist as a craftsman, as had been the conventional view during the Middle Ages. This was bitterly unacceptable to Dürer, whose second Self-Portrait (out of three) shows him as slender and aristocratic, a haughty and foppish youth, ringletted and impassive. His stylish and expensive costume indicates, like the dramatic mountain view through the window (implying wider horizons), that he considers himself no mere limited provincial. What Dürer insists on above all else is his dignity, and this was a quality that he allowed to others too.This picture was acquired by Charles I of England and later bought by Philip IV of Spain","['Oil', 'panel']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['German'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a man with long hair and a white beard,"DÜRER, Albrecht",Self-Portrait at 26,Images\12490-05self26.jpg,"(121, 87, 52)","(175, 146, 103)","(58, 38, 23)",,0.2110010125138852,0.2038298583463584,0.4166617515507191,0.1685073775890373,"(58, 38, 23)","(121, 87, 52)","(175, 146, 103)",

He stands before his easel, holding his palette in a pose intentionally reminiscent of a self-portrait by Rembrandt which was then in the Louvre and well known to van Gogh. Perhaps the painting should be read as a kind of manifesto of the new orientation in his conception of himself as an artist and of his work - the intention to remove himself from the city and its bourgeois lifestyle, and the desire to be seen in a Dutch rather than a French tradition. The painting also betrays a growing confidence in himself as an artist: he appears with the insignia of his profession. Greater assurance is also evident in the handling. The earlier extreme experimentation with pure or broken colour and a textured and structuring brushwork has given way to a more controlled and coherent treatment.

The objects depicted have both an allegorical and a more personal significance. The lighted candle, used in the painting of Gauguin's chair, derives from the emblematic tradition of still-life and signifies light and life; its opposite, the snuffed-out candle, was used in memento mori still-life and van Gogh had included it in a still-life with books which he painted after his father's death in 1885 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh). The optimistic note sounded by the candle flame is underlined by the presence of the sprouting onions, taken from his Yellow Chair (a 'self-portrait'). On the other hand, van Gogh has added his pipe and tobacco and an empty bottle, possibly once containing absinthe, all of which endangered his health.Modern research has intriguingly shown that absinthe itself can cause epileptic fits. Van Gogh had consumed this poisonous beverage in some quantity during the months in Arles, and many of his subsequent fits coincide with occasions on which he had access to it. The drawing board on which most of these objects are placed indicates van Gogh's resumption of work. He informed his brother that he was painting still-lifes to ease himself back into painting after his hospitalization.

33934-atalanta.jpg,"In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions.In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her.There are two versions of this paining, one in Naples and another in Madrid, and recently there have been heated debates about both their autography and dating.

11130-early21.jpg,"""Horse racing, a sport of English origin, became popular on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century, and soon inspired such painters as Carle Vernet and Théodore Géricault, who were both influenced by English artists. It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators. This led to the At the Races in the Countryside.Degas never tires of the theme of the racecourse. On September 27, 1881, the newspaper """"Le Globe"""" started publishing Major Muybridge's photographs of a galloping horse, and Degas used them for his sketches. The photographs showed that traditional English prints were inaccurate when depicting galloping horses with their front legs outstretched. This is how Degas painted the horses racing in the background of At the Races in the Countryside of 1869.Degas exhibited this moderately colourful work at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The race itself is in the background, the foreground is occupied by a family scene centred on a baby, with the nurse, mother, father and even the dog atop the box. The family is the Valpinçon family: the driver of the carriage is Degas's friend Paul Valpinçon, who is shown with his wife, a wet nurse, and in the nurse's lap, the couple's son, Henri.

40998-08virdol.jpg,"""On grounds of the inscription on the cover of the twelve panels that had originally been fastened together to form a book, the picture is considered to be the work of a painter called """"Jaques Daliwe"""", who probably had immigrated to France from the Low Countries and then worked beside the Limbourg brothers in the court of the Duc de Berry. (Though the name """"Daliwe"""" could be also a reference to the proprietor.) The artist may have used the booklet as a note-book for about twenty years. In it he put down his memories, ideas and everything he saw and considered interesting while moving from one place to another. Often, as was the case with the drawing reproduced here, he composed homogeneous scenes from the different motifs in his individual manner.As a rule the seated lamenting figures of the Virgin and St John are represented below the crucified Christ. But here both Christ and the cross have been removed and only the two of them remain in the place of the Crucifixion. In front of them there are scattered the instruments of torture, whereas behind them - as though it were their common thought - the figure of the suffering Christ is to be seen surrounded by a cloud of angels. His face is distorted by pain, His head is bowed forwards and His crossed arms have slipped slightly sideways in the sarcophagus. The imagination of His mother and His favourite disciple have enlarged His figure into monumental dimensions, but the two react to the scene in different ways: the Virgin is leaning her face onto her hand and is engrossed in her thoughts; wrapped in her cloak, she stares into space. St John is more agitated and active, and raises his head passionately.The difference between the vision and the real scene is shown not only in the scale of the figures but also in the technique of drawing. The Virgin, St John and the ground are modelled with the most delicate tints of grey, while the paler figure of Christ is interpreted by more linear means, first of all with contours, whereas the host of angels is conveyed only by gossamer fine outlines. The drawing may have been a preparatory sketch to a painting, its composition being based on a strictly geometrical framework. The central axis of the picture is indicated by two nails lying in the foreground and meeting at their tips. If we, in our imagination, lengthen their lines up to the top corners we get two smaller triangles on the two sides and a larger one in the middle of the top. The former include the figures of the Virgin and of St John respectively, whereas the latter frames Christ's figure with the angels, whose whirling movements fill up the triangle standing on its point""","['Lead', 'tempera', 'wood']",['Unknown'],['Religious'],['French'],['Renaissance'],a drawing of a group of people sitting around a table,"UNKNOWN MASTER, French",Vir Dolorum (Man of Sorrows),Images\40998-08virdol.jpg,,"(153, 160, 141)","(193, 201, 184)",,0.1926523676565981,0.3660384409284485,0.3284753363228699,0.1128338550920833,"(153, 160, 141)","(193, 201, 184)",,

26062-17rein.jpg,"This small triptych is the second altarpiece to be commissioned from Memling by a brother at St John's Hospital in Bruges, the first being the Floreins triptych. The donor has been identified as Adriaan Reins on the basis of the initials AR on the frame and the figure of St Adrian who protects him in the left wing. Reins was received into the Order in 1479, and died in 1490.The principal scene is a Lamentation on Golgotha beneath a glowering evening sky. The left wing represents the donor with his patron saint, while the right wing features St Barbara, the hospital saint par excellence.The composition is a development on an idea of Rogier van der Weyden, who was the first to reduce the Lamentation to its three principal protagonists (apart from Christ) in a number of smaller compositions. The body with its stiff, open arms and closed legs, knelt over by the praying Virgin, first appears in another work by the same master, namely the Lamentation in The Hague (Mauritshuis). The scene as a whole is portrayed in deep and sombre tones. The predominance of purple - including the marbling of the frame - means that the altarpiece is literally enveloped in the colour of the Passion.Two versions of this Lamentation are known: the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych in Rotterdam and the Rome Lamentation, both of which were probably painted at an earlier date. The former in particular may be seen as the immediate compositional predecessor of the Reins triptych.Doubts as to the authorship of the work were expressed from an early stage, probably because the figures of St John and Mary Magdalene did not meet the idealised Memling image that had been formed by the nineteenth century, and because of the lack of an inscription with the artist's signature. Despite these doubts, this little triptych is a masterpiece, executed with the utmost delicacy.The central panel was partially copied (landscape, Christ and St John) in the Santa Barbara Lamentation by a follower of Memling from the late fifteenth century","['Oil', 'oak', 'panel']",['Unknown'],['Religious'],['Flemish'],['Renaissance'],three paintings of person being nailed to the cross,"MEMLING, Hans",Triptych of Adriaan Reins,Images\26062-17rein.jpg,,"(85, 64, 55)","(33, 24, 20)",,0.1677305977826037,0.370556635044005,0.3608621937745266,0.1008505733988646,"(85, 64, 55)","(33, 24, 20)",,

19908-06henry8.jpg,"""This painting was one of a group of English portraits carried out by Holbein and his school. Though German, Holbein was court painter to King Henry VIII of England, and the prototype for this image is his lost mural that once decorated the Privy Chamber of Whitehall Palace in London. Carried out in 1537, that wall painting depicted the king with his third wife Jane Seymour, the only one of Henry's queens to bear him a male heir. Of the numerous paintings derived from that prototype, including a copy at Windsor Castle, this is without doubt the one of highest quality. The closest example to the prototype, on the other hand, is the portrait in the Thyssen collection in Madrid, which this version approaches especially in the rendering of the details of the collar (these passages were later modified, as is visible through reflectography).The Barberini portrait depicts the king in the same costume that he wore for his April, 1540, wedding to Anne of Cleves. The painting can thus be related to Duren's 1539 marriage portrait of Anne of Cleves (Louvre Museum, Paris), carried out in small dimensions and on canvas as it was meant to be transported.The attribution of the Rome version has been the subject of much discourse. It was considered to be an autograph work of Holbein, a copy of a lost original, the work of the master's workshop, the work of a close collaborator. An official engraving cut after this composition (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), adherent in its details to the Barberini picture, confirms the importance of this version of the image to the iconography of the king. Moreover, reflectographic examination of the painting has revealed characteristic underdrawing and other details that strongly suggest that the work is an autograph Holbein.The painting bears the inscription """"ANNO ETATIS SUAE XLIX"""" (His year of age, 49).""","['Oil', 'panel']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['German'],['Renaissance'],a portrait of a man in a red and gold outfit,"HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger",Portrait of Henry VIII,Images\19908-06henry8.jpg,,"(61, 43, 40)","(121, 76, 53)",,0.1659313725490196,0.5100037707390649,0.2272197083961789,0.0968451483157365,"(61, 43, 40)","(121, 76, 53)",,

05055-landscap.jpg,"During his lifetime Bonzi was particularly renowned for his still-lifes, but, like Filippo Napoletano, he was also active as a painter of landscapes.

In addition to this canvas, Bonzi's certain works include The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and The Rest of Hercules (both in the Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome), Nymph and Faun (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini, Rome) and Latona and the Frogs (Musée du Louvre, Paris).Bonzi was clearly influenced by Annibale Carracci and to an even greater extent by Domenichino, but his compositions are more open on both sides and his terrain much flatter. His foregrounds spread out freely without obstacles such as large rocks or bushes, almost inviting the viewer to walk into the picture. His rather awkward figures tend to move parallel to the picture plane in a frieze-like procession. In the early 1620s he worked at the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal hill with Filippo Napoletano, each decorating different rooms. In this landscape Bonzi's close attention to naturalistic detail suggests the influence of Bril. Establishing a chronology for Bonzi's landscapes is almost impossible, but this work is perhaps not too far in date from the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi frescoes. The shepherds' nakedness indicates that the scene is not contemporary (even though sheep-farming had largely replaced cultivation in the Roman campagna around this time), but rather an episode from Virgil's Arcadia","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],['Baroque'],a painting of cattle grazing in a landscape,"BONZI, Pietro Paolo",Landscape with Shepherds and Sheep,Images\05055-landscap.jpg,,"(55, 32, 27)","(231, 208, 180)","(109, 81, 65)",0.1633253719460616,0.3932999950241329,0.2397347862865104,0.203639846743295,"(55, 32, 27)","(231, 208, 180)","(109, 81, 65)",

The intervention of El Greco's workshop can be assumed in all these paintings.In his religious compositions and portraits El Greco frequently repeated themes from his major works, with slight alterations, to meet different commissions. He broke away from the Renaissance tradition and ceased to depict reality and nature. In order to convey mystic emotions and to imbue his work with passion he distorted and elongated the forms and used stridently blazing colours to express the transcendental.

19686-westerke.jpg,"The works of Jan van der Heyden, one of the finest city-view specialists, are responsible for our general impressions of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite.Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building.Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal","['Oil', 'panel']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['Dutch'],['Baroque'],a painting of a church with people walking on the water,"HEYDEN, Jan van der","View of the Westerkerk, Amsterdam",Images\19686-westerke.jpg,,"(72, 48, 47)",,"(243, 240, 230)",0.145624673604894,0.376974690390928,0.1437199250223813,0.3336807109817964,"(72, 48, 47)","(243, 240, 230)",,
15231-4recamie.jpg,"This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. David started the portrait of Madame Récamier in 1800 which was never finished. (However, incidentally, this portrait helped a contemporary item of furniture to become known under her name.) When the master learned that the lady had also commissioned his pupil Gérard to paint her, he is said to have refused any further service.In David's portrait, noble simplicity, expressed by the simple dress and the Spartan decoration, is also eloquent in the open face. This might well appear more to the modern viewer than Gérard's version, which was judged to be more representative and flattering at the time. And comparisons with portraits of Madame Récamier by other artists suggest that Gérard had achieved a better likeness than David. The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.Gérard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation. Her low-cut bodice is seductive, the red curtain flatters the subject and gives the flesh a rosy tint. Where David gave the beautiful woman a rather severe touch around the mouth, Gérard embellishes her features with the hint of a gentle smile, making her look younger. By contrast, David's portrait in the antique manner looks rather forced. Perhaps these were the reasons why his painting was never finished. Madame Récamier gave Gérard's portrait of her to her admirer Prince Augustus of Prussia, a nephew of Frederick II, who had met the French beauty at the salon of Madame de Sta&#235;l. For state reasons a marriage was impossible, but in the painting Madame Récamier was ever present in the palace which Schinkel furnished for the Prince in 1817.After the death of the Prince the portrait was returned to Madame Récamier","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['French'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a woman sitting on a chair,"GÉRARD, François",Madame Récamier,Images\15231-4recamie.jpg,,"(42, 32, 19)",,"(112, 69, 40)",0.145423606557377,0.4162216393442623,0.1285101639344262,0.3098445901639344,"(42, 32, 19)","(112, 69, 40)",,

His shop had become a kind of gallery of their paintings, for Tanguy would take paintings on deposit as credit for the painting materials he supplied. Van Gogh painted two portraits of Père Tanguy in the autumn and early winter of 1887, both against a background composed of Japanese colour woodcuts which he had begun to collect, firstly in Antwerp and then more avidly in Paris. Tanguy is placed massively in the centre of the canvas, facing the spectator. But the Paris merchant is presented not against an urban or even French setting, but in an imaginary context composed of Japanese seasonal scenes and costumed figures. Although this choice of background indicates van Gogh's evident preoccupation with Japanese prints - he also made individual copies of selected prints at this date - the painting does not indicate any profound influence of Japanese graphic styles or perspectival devices upon his work. But it is important to note that the motifs represented in the prints anticipate those that van Gogh would shortly resume when he left Paris and moved once again into a more rural setting - seasonal landscapes and portraits of regional types in costume.In his portraits of ordinary people van Gogh emphasized their sadness, dignity and kindness.

Scholars do not agree on the dating of this canvas and suggestions go from 1491, the same year as the Apotheosis of St Ursula, to 1493, the year of the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula. Even the question of the identification of the character in red standing next to Pope Cyriacus as Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Humanist and the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1493 after having fallen out of grace in Venice, is used in different ways by the advocates of the various chronological theories. The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490.The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo.

03766-031madon.jpg,"""Of all the still youthful Madonnas by Bellini the masterpiece is the so called Greek Madonna of the Brera Gallery in Milan, which entered the Museum in 1808 following the Napoleonic repression. It was originally in the Ducal Palace in Venice. According to some sources the figures were originally set against a gold background, on which the words """"Mother of God"""" and """"Christ"""" were written in Greek (hence the name of the painting). Obviously, a background of this type would have made it archaic and """"archaizing"""", considerably accentuating the Byzantine appearance of the panel, a veritable Marian icon. The 1986 restoration has established that the still remaining traces of gold beside the Greek letters were a 16th-century addition, while Bellini had originally conceived the sky as it appears now: blue and almost entirely covered by a small curtain held up by a cord. Over the traditional preparatory ground (gypsum and animal glue) he had sketched out the preliminary drawing, marking in with extreme precision even the chiaroscuro with subtle and highly regular criss-cross strokes which can be seen in infra-red photography. This technique used by Bellini must have been famous if Paolo Pino in his Dialogo di pittura (1548) writes that """"drawing the painting with such extreme diligence, composing it with chiaro and scuro as Giovanni Bellino was wont to do"""" was to be discouraged """"for it is work thrown away since everything must be covered with the colours"""".This type of drawing shows similarities with the rigorous Flemish constructive technique, though under closer scrutiny it appears to be aimed at a search for a much more solid and volumetrically constructed plastic quality.

11024-503david.jpg,"David's first history painting in exile was an extremely original and disturbing interpretation of the late antique myth of Cupid and Psyche. It was painted for the wealthy Italian patron and connoisseur Count Giovanni Battista Sommariva and, although planned in Paris, it was only finished in Brussels in 1817.As related by the Roman writer Lucius Apuleius in The Golden Ass (late second century AD), Cupid, the god of love, fell in love with the beautiful Psyche and brought her to his palace, where he visited her every night without ever letting her see his face. But curiosity got the better of her, and one night Psyche looked at Cupid while he was asleep. Unfortunately a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp and awakened him, whereupon he abandoned her and the palace disappeared. From then on Psyche was condemned to wander the earth and perform impossible tasks in the vain hope of winning her lover back.Many other artists saw the lovers as innocent, tender and poetic, but David deliberately drew attention to the sexual aspect of the relationship. Normally Cupid was shown as a beautiful young man, but David depicted him as a grinning adolescent who seems proud of his recent conquest. A great contrast is set up between Cupid's coarse ruddy features and awkward angular limbs, and the pale, smooth and languid beauty of the sleeping Psyche. Unusually for David, the colours are bright and intense; in Brussels he looked at the colours used by Flemish Renaissance artists such as Jan van Eyck.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Mythological'],['French'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a woman laying on a bed,"DAVID, Jacques-Louis",Cupid and Psyche,Images\11024-503david.jpg,,"(19, 17, 18)",,,0.1286697868719297,0.622175376165242,0.0579378279761214,0.1912170089867069,"(19, 17, 18)",,,

19904-02seymou.jpg,"Jane Seymour (1509-1537) was the third wife of King Henry VIII of England and mother of King Edward VI. She succeeded - where Henry's previous wives had failed - in providing a legitimate male heir to the throne.Jane's father was Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, Savernake, Wiltshire. She became a lady in waiting to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then to Anne Boleyn, who married the King in 1533. Henry probably became attracted to Jane in 1535, when he visited her father at Wolf Hall, but, though willing to marry him, she refused to be his mistress. That determination undoubtedly helped bring about Anne Boleyn's downfall and execution (May 19, 1536). On May 30, 1536, Henry and Jane were married privately.During the remaining 17 months of her life Jane managed to restore Mary, Henry's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, to the King's favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and some scholars have interpreted Jane's intercession to mean that she had little sympathy with the English Reformation. The future Edward VI was born on October 12, 1537, but, to Henry's genuine sorrow, Jane died 12 days later.Holbein executed this portrait shortly after the marriage of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. In attitude and expression, the Seymour portrait matches that in the Whitehall composition, but the portraits differ in the arrangement of the bonnet veil; this individual portrait follows the preparatory study in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. This change is important only from a compositional point of view, and probably derived from Holbein himself. However, the major changes in tonality and patterns in Jane's gown will probably have been undertaken only after consultation with the client.Holbein's portrait depicts a figure frozen in an official sense of responsibility. The simplicity of the shadowed background accentuates the increasing richness and boldness of design and adornment in Henrician court fashion, and the artist's skill is pre-eminent in creating the sheen and lustre of the precious stones. Great attention has been paid to the realism of the silver thread in the queen's dress, and this new opulence was to be echoed in the portrait of Henry himself.","['Oil', 'wood']",['Horizontal'],['Portrait'],['German'],['Renaissance'],a painting of a woman in a red dress,"HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger","Jane Seymour, Queen of England",Images\19904-02seymou.jpg,,"(79, 63, 59)",,"(35, 29, 27)",0.1249591856333429,0.4516623451454912,0.1216047248631518,0.301773744358014,"(79, 63, 59)","(35, 29, 27)",,

32309-07moses.jpg,"This painting, the latest and grandest of Poussin's three versions of the theme, was acquired by the National Gallery jointly with the National Museum of Wales in 1988 and is shown alternately in London and Cardiff. Poussin illustrated events from the life of Moses at least nineteen times. It has been pointed out that when he could, he avoided painting scenes of saintly visions or martyrdoms, the stock-in-trade of seventeenth-century religious art. He concentrated instead on the central themes of Christianity, relating them both to their historical context in the ancient Near East and to the basic tenets of other religions, following an intellectual fashion of the day. Of the Old Testament subjects which he painted, the majority belong to the category of types, or prefigurations, of Salvation.From Early Christian times the Old Testament was read by Christians for its analogies with the New. Thus the waters of the Nile to which the infant Moses is consigned by his mother in 'an ark of bulrushes', following Pharaoh's cruel order to drown all the male Israelite babies (Exodus 1:2), were likened to the waters of baptism. But Poussin's interest in Moses may have been prompted also by his identification with pagan deities; as a contemporary writer influenced by these ideas wrote of this picture: 'He is Moses, the Mosche of the Hebrews, the Pan of the Arcadians, the Priapus of the Hellespont, the Anubis of the Egyptians.'All these ideas reverberate throughout the painting. The baby on whom Pharaoh's daughter has taken pity resembles the Christ Child blessing the Magi or the shepherds in a scene of the Adoration. In the background on the left an Egyptian priest worships the dog-shaped god Anubis (barely visible now that the surface paint has grown thin and transparent). We know we are in Egypt because on the rock above the main scene a river god, symbolising the Nile, embraces a sphinx, palm trees stand on the shore and an obelisk rises up behind a stately temple. (Curiously, the many-windowed buildings with which Poussin, who had never been there, endows Pharaoh's country now resemble modern resort hotels.)The main interest and beauty of the painting, however, do not reside in its possible symbolism, but in the wonderful grouping of the figures, all women to contrast with an analogous group of men in Christ healing the Blind Man (now in the Louvre), painted for the same patron the year before. Each plays her role in the dramatic tale, the princess generous and commanding, the maids curious and delighted. The humbler figure in a white shift at Moses' head may be his sister who watched from nearby to see what would happen to him, and recommended their mother to Pharaoh's daughter as a wet nurse. It is tempting to see their brilliant draperies as a compliment to Poussin's patron, the Lyon silk merchant Reynon. Bodies and colours, each distinct and separate, combine in ample rhythms across the picture surface, echoed by the rocks beyond. It is at once solemn and joyful, as befits a scene in which a child is rescued from death, and through him an entire people is saved.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Religious'],['French'],['Baroque'],a painting of a group of people in a landscape,"POUSSIN, Nicolas",The Finding of Moses,Images\32309-07moses.jpg,,"(38, 27, 27)","(175, 176, 191)",,0.1217354196301564,0.5214473684210527,0.2104860123281176,0.1463311996206733,"(38, 27, 27)","(175, 176, 191)",,

The heavens have opened and ranks of angels surround God the Father on his throne. Amongst the angels, who move elegantly, the depiction of God, with his delicately shimmering, bright robes and his hieratic face, gives the impression of his belonging to a different sphere.This particular effect is also the result of a different painting technique: God the Father is not painted as a fresco on the wall, but in tempera on a wooden panel. This """"door"""" was presumably opened during the mystery plays performed to celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation, in order that the dove of Annunciation could fly out. The representation of the Annunciation directly below it is an indication of this.

This tends to indicate that the picture remained in Brussels for a long time, or was in a collection in another town in the Netherlands which was easily accessible to the public.The numerous copies and variants of this painting with its theme of the Holy Baptism can also be explained by the widespread growth of the Anabaptist movement in those years of religious turbulence and strife.
