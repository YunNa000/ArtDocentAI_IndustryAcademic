04775-landsca2.jpg,"This painting is the pendant of the Landscape with a Fountain, also in the Hermitage.

05414-italian.jpg,"Jan Both was one of the best known of the Dutch painters living in Italy for varying length of time in the 17th century (the so-called Italianates). They painted landscapes without depicting a specific topography and almost all their works are imaginary compositions. Both's painting - although includes a draughtsman - is no exception. It shows a waterfall and a small gorge overgrown with bushes and trees close to a country road with a bridge which has just been crossed by a travelling party consisting of a carriage drawn by two horses led by grooms. By the side of the road are three groups of two figures each, all wearing rather rustic garbs.Judging by their poses and the sheet of paper held by one of them they are artists surveying the countryside. Opening up on the right is a broad view of the Roman campagna. Both painted the scene with remarkably light, bright colours, and exploited the effect of the sunlight to the full","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['Dutch'],['Baroque'],a painting of a river scene with figures and figures,"BOTH, Jan",Italian Landscape with Draughtsman,2.223,0.0,1,0,Beautiful scenery

07151-canal101.jpg,"This is one of a set of four paintings by Canaletto, usually regarded as his earliest surviving vedute (view paintings) of Venice. They may have been executed for a Venetian patron, possibly as decoration for the portego of a Venetian palazzo, but are first recorded in the collection of the Princes of Liechtenstein in 1806. It is a work of such extraordinary accomplishment that it is hard to believe it was not preceded by other, now lost, studies by the artist.Unlike other pictures from the same set, it shows a part of the city not found on the itinerary of most visitors. This is an area where Venetians live and work, rather than a well-known site. At the left the footway runs along before the church of San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti and the Scuola di San Marco. A wooden bridge spans the canal, while beyond it can be seen the Ponte del Cavallo. The artist has particularly exploited the colourful laundry hung out from the rooftops and windows at the right. There is a heavy, ponderous atmosphere, achieved through the dappled treatment of the silvery light and feathery brushstrokes. This approach, which in part anticipates the work of the Venetian painter Francesco Guardi (1712-93), is characteristic of Canaletto's earliest pictures.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],['Rococo'],a painting of a canal with people on it,CANALETTO,Rio dei Mendicanti,2.2,0.0,1,1,Beautiful scenery
07255-canal705.jpg,"The majestic sweep of the river, leading to a skyline dominated by St Paul's Cathedral, forms the focus of this canvas, which was made as a companion picture for The Whitehall and the Privy Garden from Richmond House. Canaletto has succeeded in creating an extraordinary sense of spaciousness: with the combination of calm water, bright clear morning light and an untroubled sky, he has brought to the London scene some of that clarity of vision, and pleasure in celebrating the attractions of a great city that he had earlier applied to Venice.The terraces in the foreground belong to Richmond House and, at the left, Montagu House. The figures on them parade, converse, and in a leisurely manner watch the spectacle of the river in the sunshine. While a number of smaller boats skull about on it, two larger decorated barges belonging to the City of London, make their way upstream. A related drawing of the scene shows a broader view, with far more traffic on the Thames.The vertical emphases of the church spires, chimneys at the left, and mooring posts in the foreground, all carefully anchor and balance the composition, which is principally ordered by the horizon and gentle diagonals of the river bank","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Unknown'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],['Rococo'],a painting of a city with boats on the water,CANALETTO,London: The Thames and the City of London from Richmond House,2.2,0.0,1,1,Beautiful scenery

This is a view from beside the Campo San Vio, looking towards the Bacino San Marco, with the dome of Santa Maria della Salute above the palaces at the right.Canaletto has included a curious detail: a depiction of a boat on the wall of the building in the right foreground. Whether this was simply sgraffito or some form of trade sign is not entirely clear. Above it a woman looks down from a small balcony; Canaletto placed similar figures at the edge of a number of his pictures, in order to close off the scene. He also perhaps was trying to convince us that there were in fact vantage points from which the panoramas he shows could be viewed.This work is from a group of early pictures by Canaletto, now in Dresden, which were part of the Elector of Saxony's collection during Canaletto's lifetime","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Unknown'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],['Rococo'],a painting of a canal with a couple on a boat,CANALETTO,Rio dei Mendicanti: Looking South,2.2,0.0,1,1,Beautiful scenery
03975-bello203.jpg,"Bellotto was not the first painter at the Saxon court employed specially to depict topographical scenes. The tradition of this type of work in Saxony reaches back at least to the first quarter of the seventeenth century and Bellotto's work ought to be interpreted within this tradition. Bellotto's paintings of Dresden show the overall picture of the city, the Zwinger, the principal squares and the two most important churches, the Kreuzkirche and the Frauenkirche. The artist also produced engravings after most of these paintings.Perpendicular to the image surface and stretching towards the east runs the Innere Rampische Gasse. The left foreground is taken up entirely by the southern wall of the Frauenkirche. This creation of Georg Bahr, completed in 1743 and destroyed in 1945, was hemmed in on all sides by buildings, so that it was impossible to gain a picture of the church in its entirety.The painter probably used a camera obscurato reduce the church's height; because of the short distance the church is represented with a marked perspective distortion. Undoubtedly in order to prevent such distortions from dominating the image completely and to achieve a better spatial effect, the church is not shown frontally. Instead, Bellotto has shifted his attention to the right, so that the view is determined by the axis of the Rampische Gasse and only the roof and south wall of the church can be seen.The Frauenkirche was the most important modern church of Dresden, the Kreuzkirche the most important old one. In the pendant to this painting (also in Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Dresden) Bellotto represented the Kreuzkirche","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Landscape'],['Italian'],"['Rococo', 'Neoclassicism']",a painting of a street scene with people walking and a horse drawn by a carton,"BELLOTTO, Bernardo","Dresden, the Frauenkirche and the Rampische Gasse",2.2,0.0,1,1,Beautiful scenery
