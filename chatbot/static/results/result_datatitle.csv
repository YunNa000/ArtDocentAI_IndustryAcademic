20291-granite.jpg,"""The years between the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848, known as the Biedermeier era, were a time of relative peace, prosperity, and innovation in German-speaking Europe. The art of the period came to be characterized by what a critic of the day called """"rigorous simplicity."""" In painting, emphasis was given to the objective recording of natural phenomena, and artists sought to achieve an enamel-like finish that masked individual brushstrokes. Landscape and portraiture grew in importance while history painting declined.Berlin was expanding rapidly, growing to fulfil its role as a major European capital. Imposing new public buildings by Schinkel and his disciples were being constructed. Painters like Eduard G&#228;rtner and Johann Erdmann Hummel chose Berlin as their subject, carefully depicting the architectural and technological wonders, like the huge granite bowl that adorned the centre of the city""","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['German'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a fountain in a park,hummel johann erdmann,Granite Basin in the Lustgarten,바닥에 놓인 거대한 흉금석 용이있는 공원에 그려진 그림입니다.,"(143, 155, 186)",1.123,0,

44509-deathque.jpg,"Sophie Amalie (1628-1685) became Queen of Denmark in 1648. She was the daughter of Duke George of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and in 1643 she was married to Frederik III. She was the mother of Christian V. In spite of the dire financial situation of the Kingdom, she was the centre of a sumptuous court life, with exclusive luxury items and grand parties, which shed glory on the royal power.The present painting belongs to the group of around 100 pictures, studies, and sculptures that Zahrtmann created on the basis of Leonora Christine's (1621-1698) memoirs from 1869. Her life and destiny, spanning the range from wealth and power through imprisonment and shame to rehabilitation and release, fascinated Zahrtmann for almost 50 years. Sophie Amalie was behind Leonora Christine's arrest and 22 years of imprisonment in Blatarn. Zahrtmann hated her for that, and his sentiments are apparent with exceptional honesty in this depiction of her death throes.Surrounded by silverware and magnificent silks, the dowager queen Sophie Amalie breathes her last.
