14316-adorati2.jpg,"This panel comes from the church of Santa Maria della Misericordia in Bologna, where it formed a predella to a Renaissance altarpiece. Executed with great technical expertise, this painting from Francesco Francia's mature period enchants the viewer particularly with the perfect harmony achieved between the iconic subject and the naturalistic setting. On the left we see the adoration of the Child. On the right, the pictorial story continues with a subtle evocation of an allegorical subject fairly rare at the time: St Augustine hesitating between the blood of Christ and the Virgin's milk. The inspiration behind this picture is Raphaelesque","['Tempera', 'panel']",['Vertical'],['Religious'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],"the ann of the virgin and the ann of the virgin, by person, in a painting by person","FRANCIA, Francesco",Adoration of the Child,1.123,0.0,Devil
39460-4entombm.jpg,"The church of San Giorgio Maggiore was built on the San Giorgio Island between 1566 and 1600 using the design of Palladio. After 1590 the workshop of Tintoretto was commissioned to paint big canvases for decorating it. Due the large number of commissions, Tintoretto in his late years increasingly relied on his coworkers. However, three surviving paintings placed in a chapel consecrated in 1592 - The Jews in the Desert, The Last Supper and Entombment - were certainly painted by Tintoretto himself.It is remarkable on this picture that the dead Christ and the fainted Mary is depicted in similar position in two different groups of figures. The representation of the figures is rather simplified, and therefore, the composition shows some similarity to late medieval, Venetian-Byzantine type passion scenes","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Religious'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],the cr and the virgin,TINTORETTO,Entombment,1.123,0.0,Devil
03409-03calvar.jpg,"Much of the impact of the composition derives from its dynamic organisation along the main diagonals. We 'enter' the scene from the bottom right corner, where Saint Veronica in her Venetian gown strains forward to wipe the sweat and blood off Christ's face; follow the lines of the wooden upright of the cross, Christ's body collapsed under the weight, the tormentor's brutal blows, to the furthest point in the upper left, where the executioner pulls on the rope around Christ's waist, urging him on to Golgotha in the distance. His windblown cloak picks up the red of Veronica's dress. Alternatively, we can scan the picture from upper right, from the mounted officers pointing to and discussing the events below; follow the wooden lance shaft to where John's green cloak, seized by a soldier, seems to flow around the head-dresses and shoulders of the Maries into Veronica's out-thrust veil. The Virgin's dark mantle isolates her as she stands, becalmed in the jostling crowd, wiping the tears from her eyes.However we read the painting, we are inexorably drawn to Christ, crowned with thorns. Although his eyes turn to Veronica, his is the only figure depicted virtually in full face, the Man of Sorrows of devotional imagery","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Horizontal'],['Religious'],['Italian'],['Renaissance'],a painting of people gathered around a body,"BASSANO, Jacopo",The Way to Calvary,1.123,0.0,Devil
12289-verso26.jpg,"The picture shows one of the 26 narrative scenes from the Stories of the Passion on the reverse side of the Maest&#224;. It is situated in the upper row on the right side above the scene of Appearence to Mary Magdalene (Noli me tangere).Only the Gospel of Luke mentions that Christ, dressed like a pilgrim, appeared to the disciples on their way to Emmaus. Duccio adhered to the Gospel text, reproducing the portrait of an authentic medieval pilgrim: he is distinguished by the knapsack on his shoulder, the pilgrim's staff and the typical wide-brimmed hat. As in the lower scene, the composition is directed towards the right, where there is a village on a hill. An interesting detail is the paved road appearing in two variations: partly with round cobblestones and, below the main gate, with regularly cut stones geometrically laid out","['Tempera', 'wood']",['Vertical'],['Religious'],['Italian'],"['Medieval', 'Period']",the ann of the ann of the ann of the ann of the ann of the ann of the ann,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,Road to Emmaus (scene 26),1.123,0.0,Devil
11317-505delac.jpg,"As the acknowledged master of monumental civic decoration, Delacroix could afford to stand aside from one of the major enterprises of his time, the decoration of religious monuments. But the Saints-Anges chapel at the church of Saint-Sulpice provided the opportunity for a kind of last testament. By a decree dated 28 April, 1849, Delacroix was commissioned to decorate a chapel at Saint-Sulpice. However, the urgent demands made by his numerous civic commissions and the doubtful state of his health hindered him fulfilling the decree. Only twelve years later, in 1861, did he complete the chapel. Given that it was consecrated to the Holy Angels, Delacroix chose to represent Saint Michael Defeats the Devil on the ceiling, and Jacob Wrestling with the Angel and Heliodorus Driven from the Temple on the walls. Now badly weakened by illness, he relied heavily on the help of his faithful assistants, Pierre Andrieu and Louis Boulange.This time there was no critical consensus. There was praise for the delicate gradation of tones in the Heliodorus, which was compared to Veronese and Raphael, while Michelangelo was cited in relation to the muscular brutality of Jacob. But contemporary critics were blind to Delacroix's originality in replacing the traditional architectural background with a natural landscape. His very rich and various palette, the harmony of the colours, and, in particular, the subtlety of the greens in the foliage, prefigure the work of Corot. Delacroix here shows himself the father of Impressionism. Jacob Wrestling with the Angel has been read as a summary of Delacroix's life and work. Indeed the leitmotif of his career is the struggle - a spiritual combat - between his aspiration to classicism and his Romantic genius, between his admiration for Racine and his love of Shakespeare.","['Oil', 'wax', 'mounted', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Religious'],['French'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of an angel on a pedestal with a man on the ground,"DELACROIX, Eug?ne",St Michael defeats the Devil,0.55,0.5,Devil

04698-05devil.jpg,"At first sight the picture seems full of mystery, indeed it creates a sense of unease. The very title seems designed to evoke a shudder, and this impression is strengthened by the darkening evening with its long shadows, and above all, the building crane, which looks like a gallows. The viewer may well be attracted to the Romantic mood of the painting, but the true message is clear, and it is rather sombre. Man is bringing even the most distant and seemingly inaccessible regions under control through civilization and technical advance, and he is mastering the aspects of nature that have till now seemed unapproachable and fearful. But there is also allegory here - it is in the reference to transience. The new bridge that is being built will one day be as crumbling as the old one is now.","['Oil', 'canvas']",['Vertical'],['Landscape'],['German'],"['Romanticism', 'Realism']",a painting of a mountain scene with a bridge,"BLECHEN, Karl",Building the Devil's Bridge,0.55,0.5,Devil
